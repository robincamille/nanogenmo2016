National Novel Generation Month project

My project is titled *If on a winter's night a library cardholder*.

Project status: In progress

The script generates a new ~50,000-word novel every time it is run. It is inspired by *If on a winter's night a traveler* by Italo Calvino. 

To do: Book excerpt formatting; maybe add more pre-written blurbs; appendix?

## Synopsis
You, the protagonist, half-remember a book you read long ago and want to read again â€” but you can't remember the title. You visit each of the 216 library branches in New York City looking for it. At each library, you find a book that looks familiar and you read a page. Is this the book you've been trying to find? 

## Data
- NYPL, BPL, and QPL branch names and addresses
- Project GITenberg text files 

Note: I don't think I'll write a script that crawls the NYPL/BPL/QPL catalogs, and they don't have APIs (as far as I know). So the books the protagonist reads are random texts from Project Gutenberg that may not necessarily be found in the actual library branches. (Even though that would be way cooler.) 

## Sample excerpt

You arrive at 9 Murray Street, New York, NY and find yourself on the steps of New Amsterdam Library.

You walk every aisle, but nothing looks promising. Suddenly, a young man rushes past you, and a book falls out of his bag. 'Hey!' you call after him, but he has already left. You pick up the book and read the title: *Burning Sands*. It has a red cover and a familiar weight in your hand. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... "I shall look to you for guidance," said Muriel, opening her mouth to  yawn, and shutting it again as though remembering her manners. "I'll give you a golden rule to start with," he answered. "Be very  gracious to all foreigners, because every little politeness helps the  international situation, but behave how you like to English people,  because their social aspirations require them to speak of you as _dear_  Lady Muriel, however fiercely they burn with resentment." Muriel smiled. She had a really fascinating smile, and her teeth were  worthy of the great care she gave to them. "And how must I treat an  Egyptian--I mean an Egyptian gentleman?" she enquired. "There isn't such a thing," he laughed, having very insular ideas as to  the meaning of the word. "Well, a Prince or a Pasha or whatever they're called?" "O, that's simple enough. ...

You close the book, disappointed. This isn't the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library. You set off for the next branch on your list.
