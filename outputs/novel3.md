# If on a winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was an extraordinary book. You haven't thought about it in years, though, until this afternoon, when you remembered the book in a moment of drowsiness. *That book!* What was it called? Alas! You have forgotten the title.

But you feel sure that you could recognize it by sight, or at least in reading the first few pages. And surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. You must find it; you must read it. It's only 4:00. You have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the nearest library branch.

You arrive at 112 East 96th Street, in Manhattan, and find yourself on the steps of 96th Street Library.

As soon as you enter, you see a familiar-looking red book on display in an exhibit. You snatch it up and read the title: *Quit Your Worrying!*. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... What matter if I stand alone? I wait with joy the coming years; My heart shall reap where it has sown, And garner up its fruit of tears. The waters know their own and draw The brook that springs in yonder height, So flows the good with equal law Unto the soul of pure delight. The stars come nightly to the sky; The tidal wave unto the sea; Nor time, nor space, nor deep, nor high Can keep my own away from me. I have been wonderfully struck by the fact that in studying the Upanishads, and other sacred books of the East, there is practically no reference to the kind of worry that is the bane and curse of our Occidental world. In conversation with the learned men of the Orient I find this same delightful fact. Indeed they have no word in their languages to express our idea of fretful worry. ...

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list, just a subway ride away.

You arrive at 9727 Seaview Avenue, in Brooklyn, and find yourself on the steps of Jamaica Bay Library.

You approach a librarian at the reference desk. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*History of the Constitutions of Iowa*.' 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... Here Constitution means not abstract philosophic principles of Government, but concrete political phenomena, that is, political facts. Our constitutional historians do not as a rule deal directly with the ultimate principles of government; but they are concerned rather with their progressive phenomenal manifestations in the assembly, the court, the office, the caucus, the convention, the platform, the election, and the like. Thus Constitutional History is simply a record of concrete political facts. It is, however, in the literature of Jurisprudence that the term "Constitution" is used in accordance with an exact definition. Constitutional Law, or the Law of the Constitution, means a very definite thing to the Jurist. ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You board a bus headed toward another nearby library branch.

Ask Casey." Casey scratched his head thoughtfully. "Dongolas?" he repeated. "I have heard th' word, Grevemeyer. Wait a bit! 'Tis something about shoes. Sure! I remimber, now! 'Twas dongola shoes wan of me kids had, last winter, an' no good they were, too. Dongolas is shoes, Grevemeyer--laced shoes--dongolas is laced shoes." The big mayor leaned his head far back and laughed long and loud. He pounded on the bar with his fist, and slapped Toole on the back. "Laced shoes!" he cried, wiping his eyes, and then he became suddenly serious. "'Twould not be shoes, Casey," he said gravely. "Thim dongolas was ricomminded by th' landscape-gardener from New Yorrk. ...

> ... He was angry with Karl, for having made a fool of himself by turning patriot, or "rebel," as it pleases crowned monsters to term it. He had intended him for better things; a secretary to some great noble, a post in the Custom-house, or, may be, a commission in the bodyguard of some petty tyrant. Any of these would have fulfilled the ambitious hopes of Karl's father. The latter, therefore, was displeased with the conduct of his son. Karl had no hope from home, at least until the anger of the old man should die out. What was the young refugee to do? He found English hospitality cold enough. He was free enough; that is, to wander the streets and beg. Fortunately, he bethought him of a resource. At intervals, during his life, he had aided his father in the occupation of gardening. He could dig, plant, and sow. He could prune trees, and propagate flowers to perfection. ...

This doesn't sound familiar at all. Frowning, you leave the book on a reshelving cart and stride out into the evening air, ready to try another library branch. Maybe your luck will change.

> ... Then there was "Jimmy." He was a negro, rather undersized and as black as the inside of a lump of coal. He appointed himself our special guardian, a sort of valet, overseer and servant. He looked after our personal belongings, cooked our food, made our tea and devoted himself exclusively to us. Twenty paddlemen were also engaged. Sixteen of them were quite as black as our Jimmy, and four of them were in varying shades from tobacco brown to light molasses candy tint. These latter were of mixed Dutch and Negro blood. "They are 'Bovianders,'" said the captain. "Queer tribal name," I commented. The captain laughed. "Not exactly a tribal name," he explained. "They live up the river quite a distance and so it is said that they come from 'above yonder. ...

> ... I want in this book to track it, if I can, to its lair, to see what it is, where its awful power lies, and what, if anything, one can do to resist it. It seems the most unreal thing in the world, when one is on the other side of it; and yet face to face with it, it has a strength, a poignancy, a paralysing power, which makes it seem like a personal and specific ill-will, issuing in a sort of dreadful enchantment or spell, which renders it impossible to withstand. Yet, strange to say, it has not exercised its power in the few occasions in my life when it would seem to have been really justified. Let me quote an instance or two which will illustrate what I mean. I was confronted once with the necessity of a small surgical operation, quite unexpectedly. If I had known beforehand that it was to be done, I should have depicted every incident with horror and misery. ...

The statue, modeled by Robert Henze, is to be cast in bronze. It represents Barbara Uttmann in the costume worn at the time of the Reformation. She points to a piece of lace, which she has just completed, lying on the cushion, the shuttles being visible. Some point, Valenciennes, and Guipure laces are made on a cushion by hand, with bobbins on which the thread is wound, the pins for giving the desired pattern to the lace being stuck into the cushion. A yard of hand cushion lace has been sold in England for as much as $25,000. The annexed cut, representing the Barbara Uttmann statue, was taken from the _Illustrirte Zeitung_. * * * * * A Boston paper tells of a man who built two houses side by side, one for himself and one to sell. ...

> ... In our part of the country in those days the leading citizens were prone to take offense at some of the things that were said of them in the public prints and given to expressing their sense of annoyance forcibly. When a high-spirited Southern gentleman, regarding whom something of a disagreeable nature had appeared in the news columns, entered the editorial sanctum without knocking, wearing upon his crimsoned face an expression of forthright irritation and with his right hand stealing back under his coat skirt, it was time for the offending reporter to emulate the common example of the native white-throated nut-hatch and either flit thence rapidly or hunt a hole. Since prohibition came in and a hiccup became a mark of affluence instead of a social error, as formerly, and a loaded flank is a sign of hospitality rather than of menace, things may have changed. ...

In June last this vessel was instrumental in saving the brigantine "Hector," with eighty lives on board, from being wrecked on Breaksea Spit. In Great Sandy Strait and the Mary River there are no less than 50 lights, most of which are leading lights burning day and night. These lights keep two steam launches with their crews constantly at work attending to them; the system is elaborate, but very costly. BURNETT RIVER. ...

> ... Is it not the consciousness of existence, together with a consciousness of the power of choice? Our individuality lies in the fact that we can decide, choose, and rule among the various contestant impulses of our souls. Herein is the possibility of victory and also the possibility of defeat. Looking inward, we find that Self began when man began. We inherit our dispositions from Adam, as well as from our parents and a long ancestral line. When the first men and women were created, forces were set in action which have resulted in this Me that to-day thinks and wills and loves. Heredity includes savagery and culture, health and disease, empire and serfdom, hope and despair. Each man can say: "In me rise impulses that ran riot in the veins of Anak, that belonged to Libyan slaves and to the Ptolemaic line. I am Aryan and Semite, Roman and Teuton: alike I have known the galley and the palm-set court of kings. ...

> ... And why should it be thought unreasonable that persons in our employment, and our children, who early notice the character of our religion, might receive some good impression, as to the nature of the Sabbath, by seeing us deny ourselves what on other days is innocent and right? I am not pleading that the Sabbath be made a day for afflicting our souls, but that we should not permit our sensual desires to interfere with our spiritual delight. On days of unusual political interest, we count it no sacrifice to be _deprived_ of a regular meal, or to take of that which comes to hand, because our delight is elsewhere. Let the same interest be felt in the Sabbath, and we shall be equally loth to permit that, which might be done on Saturday, to interfere with our enjoyment and spiritual profit. ...

"`Polly,' I says at last, breaking the silence, `ain't this heavenly?' "`And you feel better?' she says, laying her hand on mine. "`Better!'

"Give us land," they said to the Romans, and when land was denied them and the gates of cities disdainfully closed upon their messengers, not land, but vengeance, was their cry; and hordes of half-naked barbarians trampled down the vineyards, and rushed, a tumultuous torrent, upon Rome. The Romans could not stand before this new and strange kind of warfare. The Gauls streamed over the vanquished legions into the Eternal City, silent and deserted save only by the Senate and a few who remained intrenched in the Citadel; and there the barbarians kept them besieged for seven months, while they made themselves at home amid uncomprehended luxuries. Of course Roman skill and courage at last dislodged and drove them back. But the fact remained that the Gaul had been there--master of Rome; that the iron-clad legions had been no match for his naked force, and a new sensation thrilled through the length and breadth of Gaul. ...

Never was there a woman, we may believe, more retiring or peculiarly domestic than she of whom we are to speak. Never, we are sure, were the materials of a life more entirely private, and in one sense confidential, than those which we are to use; for letters are all the materials we have, and letters written in the unrestrained freedom of personal friendship, in the midst of pressing cares, and with a rapidity and unstudied naturalness, which will appear in all the extracts, but are still more manifest in the entire originals. ...

She never knew what solemn black eyes burned at her when she was not looking. She left Alexandria, her family moving to another town, and in time he recovered, for there is much of beauty. But the color of her hair and the wonder of her neck stayed with him always.

They were under the surface, in the deep shelters that had been carefully planned and built, even as the first bombs began to fall. It was a brilliant idea and the only idea that could have worked. Up above, on the ruined, blasted surface of what had once been a living planet, the leady crawled and scurried, and fought Man's war. ...

'Then you, too, are a barbarian!' he exclaimed involuntarily. The other nodded, without taking offence. 'I am Conan, a Cimmerian.' 'I've heard of you.' Fresh interest quickened Balthus' gaze. No wonder the Pict had fallen victim to his own sort of subtlety. The Cimmerians were barbarians as ferocious as the Picts, and much more intelligent. Evidently Conan had spent much time among civilized men, though that contact had obviously not softened him, nor weakened any of his primitive instincts. ...

Mrs Morgan was not so young as she had been ten years ago, all which time she had waited patiently for the Fellow of All-Souls, and naturally these ten years and the patience had not improved her looks. There was a redness on her countenance nowadays which was not exactly bloom; and it stretched across her cheeks, and over the point of her nose, as she was painfully aware, poor lady. She was silent when she heard this, wondering with a passing pang whether he was sorry? But being a thoroughly sensible woman, and above indulging in those little appeals by which foolish ones confuse the calm of matrimonial friendship, she did not express the momentary feeling. ...

Little by little her face cleared, and I saw that I had made an impression, and though I could not flatter myself that any good I might do her would be lasting in its effects as long as she remained under the bad influence of her mother, I promised to come and sup with her next evening, "but on the condition," I said, "that you give me a plain meal, and one bottle of chambertin only, for you are not too well off. ...

Yet it had been precious--precious since childhood, precious as the immediate jewel of her soul, because it had been the jewel of her soul, and no one else had dreamed of its existence. Now she had shown it to other eyes--almost flaunted it. Never again could it be a joy to her. In the little room, half study, half boudoir, which was her own, there was a desk, locked in her absence, where souvenirs of the young Emperor of Rhaetia had been accumulating for years. ...

Through the mud and clay of the deserted, narrow, unpaved streets the dragoons squelched their way, under a super-deluge, for the rain was now reinforced by steady and overwhelming sheets of water descending on either side from the gutter-shaped tiles that roofed the houses.

The earliest literature relates the appearance of the spirits of those who have died as coming back to comfort or to take vengeance on the living, but always as sentient, intelligent, and with an interest in the earth they have left.

A double relation exists between the literature and the records of the Psychical Research Society. Lacy Collison-Morley, in his _Greek and Roman Ghost Stories_, speaks of the similarity between ancient tales of spirits and records of recent instances. "There are in the Fourth Book of _Gregory the Great's Dialogues_ a number of stories of the passing of souls which are curiously like some of those collected by the Psychical Research Society," he says.

He built a palace and other splendid edifices there, and it became one of his favourite places of residence. It was called Fathpur Sikri. Thither Akbar went after his campaign in Bihar in 1574, and there his intimacy with Abu-l Fazl commenced. It was at this time that the memorable Thursday evening discussions began. Akbar's resolution was to rule with even hand men of all creeds in his dominions, and he was annoyed by the intolerance and casuistry of the Ulamas or learned men of the predominant religion.

"Afterwards, when I read about the guillotine, I always thought of those saws," said the poet, whose earliest flight of fancy seems to have been this association of womanhood with the shriek of the sawmill. In 1888, just before his sixtieth birthday, Ibsen wrote out for Henrik Jaeger certain autobiographical recollections of his childhood. It is from these that the striking phrase about the scream of the saws is taken, and that is perhaps the most telling of these infant memories, many of which are slight and naive. It is interesting, however, to find that his earliest impressions of life at home were of an optimistic character. "Skien," he says, "in my young days, was an exceedingly lively and sociable place, quite unlike what it afterwards became.

> ... One of the most brilliant surgeons I ever knew, the originator of a number of important surgical methods, who, being physician as well, was remarkable in his expedients for saving life when called to counsel in grave and apparently hopeless cases, desired to write a book embodying his discoveries and devices, but said that the feeling was strong within him that he must begin his work with an account of medicine in Egypt, and trace its development down to our own time. As he was a busy man in his profession, he lacked the leisure to make the preliminary historical study, and his book was never written. Men of affairs, who, taking "the present time by the top," are looked upon as devoted to the physical and mechanical sciences, continually pay tribute to our art. ...

In 1555 we read of work at the Cross consisting of "bigging the rowme thereof," which is supposed to mean that at this time the open arches which upheld the platform were filled in, so as to form an enclosed "rowme" below. This room was entered by a door, which was secured with a lock; so that thenceforward only those having some high and official duty to perform, such as publishing a royal proclamation, could ascend to the broad base of the Cross. ...

A yellowing convolvulus climbed up a dead weed. Weeds, grass and tumbled earth were all about him. It would be no better when he went on. Still he went on. A flower or two peeped up among the weeds.

More often battles and pageants attract them. But since the revival of the religious picture is so noticeable a factor in the new movement, since the Byzantines painted almost entirely religious subjects, and finally, since a book of such drawings by a child of twelve has recently been published, I prefer to take them as my example. Daphne Alien's religious drawings have the graceful charm of childhood, but they are mere childish echoes of conventional prettiness. Her talent, when mature, will turn to the charming rather than to the vigorous. There could be no greater contrast between such drawing and that of--say--Cimabue. ...

For the rest, the falsity of this piece is according to Fleury more universally recognized than that of the decretals of Isidore: and if the donation of Constantine could still preserve any credit, to strip it of such credit, it would be sufficient to transcribe it: here follow some lines: "We attribute to the see of St. Peter all the dig- "nity, all the glory, all the authority of the imperial "power. Furthermore we give to Sylvester and to "his successors our palace of the Latran, which is "incontestibly the finest palace on earth; we give "him our crown, our mitre, our diadem, and all "our imperial vestments: we transfer to him the "imperial dignity.

A pack cloth 6 x 7 feet in size, of brown waterproof canvas weighing about 3-1/2 pounds, makes an excellent covering for the tent floor at night. On the portage blankets and odds and ends will be packed and carried on it. If one end and the two sides of the pack cloth are fitted with snap buttons it may be converted into a snug sleeping bag with a pair of blankets folded lengthwise, the bottom and sides of the blanket secured with blanket safety pins as a lining for the bag. My standby for summer camping is a fine all-wool gray blanket 72 x 78 inches in size and weighing 5-1/2 pounds. This I have found sufficient even in frosty autumn weather--always, in fact, until the weather grows cold enough to freeze streams and close them to canoe navigation. ...

I think Mr Bottomley would like to have Mr Waugh shot, and the editor of _The Nation_ confined for seven days in the Press Bureau, for having told the truth in literary form.

Colonel Youlter searched her face eagerly. Had she spoken the tongue of flattery, or of the mere conventional?

The country is better off under any other mandate, provided it gives Americans the right to teach without ruling. America's mission is educational. There's an American, though, who might seem to prove the contrary. Do you see him?" There were two Arabs in the room, talking in low tones over by the window. I could imagine the smaller of the two as a peddler of lace and filigree-silver in the States, who had taken out papers for the sake of privilege and returned full of notions to exploit his motherland.

When you are in full swing, what you have just finished (unless you are exhausted) seems to you nearly always the best piece of work that you have ever done. For your critical, inhibitory apparatus is temporarily paralyzed by the intoxication of the moment. What makes so many artists fail at these times to enjoy a maximum of pleasure and a minimum of its opposite, is that they do not train their bodies "like a strong man to run a race," and make and keep them aboundingly vital. The actual toil takes so much of their meager vitality that they have too little left with which to enjoy the resulting achievement. If they become ever so slightly intoxicated over the work, they have a dreadful morning after, whose pain they read back into the joy preceding. ...

Erected ten years before as a monument to one of Riverview's wealthy citizens, its chimes could be heard for nearly a mile on a still night. On one side, its high, narrow windows overlooked the city, while on the other, the cultivated lands of truck farmers. "How strange!" Penny murmured as the last stroke of the clock died away.

They had stood there only a moment when below them a door opened, and a small figure slipped through. ...

The prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate expressions of gratitude--ending with-- "If ever thou shouldst know misfortune--which God forefend!--may thy goodness to me this day be remembered and requited!" Tom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said-- "My lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man's ferocious doom?" "It is the law, your Grace--for poisoners.

Your famous attempt to explain some of the incongruous and apparently ridiculous passages in our ancient manuscripts by assuming the existence of a now-vanished female principle is irrefutably demonstrated by these women, Your Excellency. Here, the female principle exists, and as you predicted, most of the women are therefore entirely different from ours. The term used in this language is "femininity." It is a devastatingly attractive thing--but almost impossible to explain. I will make an attempt. Senseless, reasonless, even foolish motions of the body and the hands, the expressions of the eyes and the mouth, the way the head is moved and tilted are a part of it.

If, as he more than half suspected, the island was a rendezvous for cattle thieves, a place surely admirably fitted by nature for such unlawful operations, the rustlers were either overconfident of the inaccessibility of their retreat and kept no lookout, or they were insolently indifferent to exposure. The former premise was the more likely. A light breeze, born of the afterglow, came scurrying down the river bed. Here and there, where the sand was finest and driest, it rose in little whirlwinds. No sound broke the stillness of the summer evening. What was that? Coyotes barking over yonder across the river? That alien sound! A man's laugh, a curse, a heart-breaking bellow of pain.

Whenever a great movement sweeps through the civilized world, it generally starts from the recognition of a great social wrong and from the enthusiasm for a thorough change. But these wrongs, whether they have political or social, economic or moral character, are always the products of both physical and psychical causes. The public thinks first of all of the physical ones. There are railroad accidents: therefore improve the physical technique of the signal system; there is drunkenness: therefore remove the whiskey bottle. The psychical element is by no means ignored. Yet it is treated as if mere insight into the cause, mere good will and understanding, are sufficient to take care of the mental factors involved. ...

They wandered at will over the earth, belonging neither to this world nor to the next, restless and malignant, unable to escape from the trammels of mortal life, in the joys of which they had no part. Thus, in the _Phaedo_[15] we read of souls "prowling about tombs and sepulchres, near which, as they tell us, are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not departed pure ... These must be the souls, not of the good, but of the evil, which are compelled to wander about such places in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life." Apuleius[16] classifies the spirits of the departed for us. ...

But in the Victorian age such a rough satire would scarcely have been tolerated. Even in French the story is not easily accessible. Aside from its original setting I have found it in but one edition of Balzac, the _OEuvres Completes_ issued in de luxe form by Calmann-Levy in 1879, where it is buried in the twenty-first volume, _OEuvres Diverses_. Therefore I make no excuse for translating and offering it to my readers, for although perhaps it was not intended for a picture of cat life, the observation on the whole is true enough, and the story itself is too delicious to pass by. ...

Just at dark, when no one was looking, Quicoy took his father's bolo and quietly slipped away to the grove down by the river. He was not afraid of ladrones, but he needed the bolo because it is not easy to open a cocoanut, and it takes some time, even with a bolo, to get the husk chopped from the fruit.

You stop reading. This isn't your book, this is some other strange text. It bothers you for some reason. You leave it on the shelf and go outside, taking calming breaths. Time to try the next library branch.

___

You arrive at 2602 Bath Avenue, in Brooklyn, and find yourself on the steps of Ulmer Park Library.

As you walk through the stacks, you bump into a tall woman. 'Excuse me,' you murmur. 'I was just looking for a book.'

She smiles politely and shelves the book she was holding. It's red and looks familiar... *Studies of American Fungi. Mushrooms, Edible, Poisonous, etc.*, it's called. You take it down from the shelf. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... The Tube Bearing Fungi; Polyporaceae, 171 Chapter X. Hedgehog Fungi; Hydnaceae, 195 Chapter XI. Coral Fungi; Clavariaceae, 200 Chapter XII. The Trembling Fungi; Tremellineae, 204 Chapter XIII. Thelephoraceae, 208 Chapter XIV. Puff-Balls; Lycoperdaceae, 209 Chapter XV. Stinkhorn Fungi; Phalloideae, 213 Chapter XVI. Morels, Cup-Fungi, Helvellas, etc., Discomycetes, 216 Chapter XVII. Collection and Preservation of the Fleshy Fungi, 222 Chapter XVIII. Selection and Preparation of Mushrooms for the Table, 229 Chapter XIX. ...

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list, just a subway ride away.

___

You arrive at 200 Clarke Avenue, in Staten Island, and find yourself on the steps of Richmondtown Library.

You approach a kindly librarian and ask him about the book you're seeking. 'I think it had a red cover,' you add hopefully.

His eyes light up. 'Ah! You must mean *Action Front*.' He leads you to the book and plucks it from the shelf. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... he snapped suddenly and savagely. "You English dog." "I understand," said Macalister. "But I'm no English. I'm a Scot" The crashing of a shell and the whistling of the bullets overhead moved the officer, as it had the others, to a more sheltered place. He seated himself upon an ammunition-box, and pointed to the wall of the trench opposite him. "You," he said to Macalister, "will stand there, where you can get the benefit of any bullets that come over. I suppose you would just as soon be killed by an English bullet as by a German one." Macalister moved to the place indicated. "I'm no anxious," he said calmly, "to be killed by either a _British_ or a German bullet." "Say 'sir' when you speak to me," roared the officer. "Say 'sir. '" Macalister looked at him and said "Sir"--no more and no less. "Have you no discipline in your English army?" he demanded, and Macalister's lips silently formed the words "British Army. ...

You close the book, disappointed. This is not the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library. You set off for the next branch on your list.

___

You arrive at 761 East 160th Street, in the Bronx, and find yourself on the steps of Woodstock Library.

As soon as you enter, you see a familiar-looking red book on display in an exhibit. You snatch it up and read the title: *My Little Lady*. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... In the evening there will be quite a little society, and we shall dance. I assure you, monsieur, that we also know how to be gay at Chaudfontaine." "I don't doubt it," answered Graham; "and though I don't care much about dancing----" "You don't care about dancing?" interrupted the Belgian with astonishment; "but that is of your nation, Monsieur. You are truly an extraordinary people, you English; you travel, you climb, you ride, you walk, and you do not dance!" "I think we dance too, sometimes," said the young Englishman, laughing; "but I own that it is walking I care for most just now--the country about here seems to be wonderfully pretty." "In fact it is not bad," said the Belgian, with the air of paying it a compliment; "and if you take care to return in time for the four o'clock _table-d'hote_, you cannot do better than make a little promenade to gain an appetite for dinner. ...

You close the book, disappointed. This is not the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library. You set off for the next branch on your list.

___

You arrive at 94-11 217 Street, in Queens Village, and find yourself on the steps of Queens Village Library.

You browse the shelves and find yourself attracted to a book entitled *This Is the End*. Is this the one you've been looking for? 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... But the real truth was that the tortoise-shell rims were more becoming to her. Mrs. Gustus was known to her husband's family as Anonyma. The origin of this habit was an old joke, and I have forgotten the point of it. Cousin Gustus was second cousin once removed to Kew and Kew's sister Jay, and had kindly brought them up from childhood. He was now at the further end of the sixties, and embittered by many things: an unsuitable marriage, the approach of the psalmist's age-limit, incurably modern surroundings, an internal complaint, and a haunting wish to relieve the Government of the management of the War. These drawbacks were to a certain extent linked, they accounted for each other. The complaint hindered him from offering his services as Secretary of State; it made of him a slave, so he could not pretend to be a master. ...

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list, just a subway ride away.

___

This is the last library branch on your list: Mill Basin Library at 2385 Ralph Avenue, in Brooklyn.

You approach a kindly librarian and ask him about the book you're seeking. 'I think it had a red cover,' you add hopefully.

His eyes light up. 'Ah! You must mean *Dotty Dimple at Her Grandmother's*.' He leads you to the book and plucks it from the shelf. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... Susy laughed, and pointed out the word "woman" to Prudy. "Why do you smile, little ladies? Isn't it writ right? 'Twas writ by a lawyer." "I will carry it in to my grandmother," said Susy; and she entered the house, followed by all the children. "Who knows but he's a _griller_?" said Jennie. "Lem _me_ see paper," cried Katie, snatching at it, and holding it up to her left ear. "O, dear!" sighed she, in a grieved tone; "it won't talk to me, Susy. I don't hear nuffin 'tall." "She's a cunning baby, so she is," said Dotty. "She s'poses writing talks to people; she thinks that's the way they read it." Grandmamma Parlin thought the man was probably an impostor. She went herself and talked with him; but, when she came back, instead of searching the closets for old garments, as Dotty had expected, she seated herself at her sewing, and did not offer to bestow a single copper on the beggar. ...

You smile to yourself. Yes, this book, this is the book. You walk to the checkout desk at 4:59pm, just before the library closes. On the train back to your apartment, you open to page 1.

It's going to be a very good night.
