# If on a winter's night a library cardholder

## Robin Camille Davis

*Generated for NaNoGenMo 2016*





Long ago, you read a book. It was an extraordinary book. You haven't though about it in years, though, until this afternoon, when you remembered the book in a moment of drowsiness. *That book!* What was it called? Alas! You have forgotten the title.

But you feel sure that you could recognize it by sight, or at least in reading the first few pages. And surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. You must find it; you must read it. It's only 4:00. You have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the nearest library branch.

You arrive at 91-41 63 Drive, in Rego Park, and find yourself on the steps of Rego Park Library.

As soon as you enter, you see a familiar-looking red book on display in an exhibit. You snatch it up and read the title: *Young Robin Hood*.

> ... Then all at once there was the pattering of feet, and half-a-dozen deer came into sight, with soft dappled coats, and one of them with large flat pointed horns; but at the first movement Robin made they dashed off among the trees in a series of bounds. Then there was another long pause, and Robin was thinking how hungry he was, when something dropped close to him with a loud rap, and looking up sharply, he caught sight of a little keen-eyed bushy-tailed animal, looking down from a great branch as if in search of something it had let fall. "Squirrel!" said Robin aloud, and the animal heard and saw him at the same moment, showing its annoyance at the presence of an intruder directly. For it began to switch its tail and scold after its fashion, loudly, its utterances seeming like a repetition of the word "chop" more or less quickly made. ...

You stop reading. This isn't your book, this is some other strange text. It bothers you for some reason. You leave it on the shelf and go outside, taking calming breaths. Time to try the next library branch.

You arrive at 524 Main Street, in Manhattan, and find yourself on the steps of Roosevelt Island Library.

You approach a librarian at the reference desk. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*The Heart of the Rose*.'

"Dorothy is different; she's a--she's--well, she's a jolly good fellow, but Rose--well, I like Rose, and every fellow better keep his hands off her. I don't want a girl all the fellows can love; but I'm different. Those things don't hurt a fellow; he's coarser and--well, it's expected of him." "But they do hurt you," she said. "The little book of memories that Rose gave you this afternoon told a story of its own. I am going to tell you this story." He looked away into the distance, and she began. * * * * * "Once there was a man who went into a garden. All around him were beautiful roses of all colours. But he chose a little white bud for his. He chose it because it was pure and white, but most of all because it was closed. No other person could see into its heart. ...

You arrive at 35-51 81 Street, in Jackson Heights, and find yourself on the steps of Jackson Heights Library.

You browse the shelves and find yourself attracted to a book entitled *Joel: A Boy of Galilee*. Is this the one you've been looking for? 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... There was a patter of many bare feet as the children raced away. Their voices sounded fainter and fainter, till they were lost entirely in the noise of the busy street. Usually, Joel found plenty to amuse and interest him here. He liked to watch the sleepy donkeys with their loads of fresh fruit and vegetables. He liked to listen to the men as they cried their wares, or chatted over the bargains with their customers. There was always something new to be seen in the stalls and booths. There was always something new to be heard in the scraps of conversation that came to him where he sat. Down this street there sometimes came long caravans; for this was "the highway to the sea,"--the road that led from Egypt to Syria. ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You board a bus headed toward another nearby library branch.

You arrive at 20 West 53rd Street, in Manhattan, and find yourself on the steps of Donnell Library Center.

As you walk through the stacks, you bump into a tall woman. 'Excuse me,' you murmur. 'I was just looking for a book.'

She smiles politely and shelves the book she was holding. It's red and looks familiar... *The Heritage of the Hills*, it's called. You take it down from the shelf.

> ... The squat man slowly holstered his gun. Then the first sound to break the silence since the shots was his voice as he spoke to the girl. "Much obliged, Jess'my," he said; then straightened in his saddle, spurred the roan, and dashed across the sidewalk to disappear around the corner of the building. A longdrawn, derisive "Hi-yi!" floated back, and the clatter of the roan's hoofbeats died away. The girl had sprung from her mare and was bending over the fallen man. The others crowded about her now, all talking at once. She lifted a white, tragic face to them, a face so wildly beautiful that, even under the stress of the moment, Oliver Drew felt that sudden fierce pang of desire which the first startled sight of "the one woman" brings to a healthy, manly man. "He's dead! I've killed him!" she cried. "No, no, no, Miss Jessamy," protested a hoarse voice quickly. "You wasn't to blame." "O' course not!" chorused a dozen. ...

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list, just a subway ride away.

> ... Of the lessons that are impressed upon us by his whole life and work rather than by specific teachings, perhaps the most precious is the inspiration to live our lives thoughtfully, in no haphazard and hand-to-mouth way, and to live always for the idea and the spirit, making all things else subservient. He does not dazzle us with extraordinary power prodigally spent, but he was a good steward of natural gifts, high, though below the highest. His life of forethought and reason may be profitably compared with a life spoiled by passion and animalism like that of Byron or of Burns. His counsels are the fruit of this well-ordered life and are perfectly in consonance with it. While he was a man of less striking personality and less brilliant literary gift than some of his contemporaries, and though his appeal was without the moving power that comes from great emotion, we find a compensation in his greater balance and sanity. ...

Why should not an Irishman make a good diver?" "Because he's too excitable, as a rule," replied Baldwin. "You see, Mister Edgar, it takes a cool, quiet, collected sort of man to make a good diver, and Irishmen ain't so cool as I should wish. Englishmen are better, but the best of all are Scotchmen. ...

This doesn't sound familiar at all. Frowning, you leave the book on a reshelving cart and stride out into the evening air, ready to try another library branch. Maybe your luck will change.

> ... A clap of thunder spoke with the voice of a thousand cannon, and I poled for bare life from that haunted backwater. I was drenched to the skin when I got in, and I ran up all the way from the stage." "Well?" rapped the other again, as Cairn paused to refill his pipe. "It was seeing the firelight flickering at Ferrara's window that led me to do it. I don't often call on him; but I thought that a rub down before the fire and a glass of toddy would put me right. The storm had abated as I got to the foot of his stair--only a distant rolling of thunder. "Then, out of the shadows--it was quite dark--into the flickering light of the lamp came somebody all muffled up. I started horribly. It was a girl, quite a pretty girl, too, but very pale, and with over-bright eyes. She gave one quick glance up into my face, muttered something, an apology, I think, and drew back again into her hiding-place." "He's been warned," growled Sime. ...

> ... I've followed milling these twenty years, and made some little money. But I got tired of hard work, and determined to lead an easier life. So I sold my mill, and built this house with the money. I always thought I'd like tavern-keeping. It's an easy life; and, if rightly seen after, one in which a man is sure to make money." "You were still doing a fair business with your mill?" "Oh, yes. Whatever I do, I do right. Last year, I put by a thousand dollars above all expenses, which is not bad, I can assure you, for a mere grist mill. If the present owner comes out even, he'll do well!" "How is that?" "Oh, he's no miller. Give him the best wheat that is grown, and he'll ruin it in grinding. He takes the life out of every grain. I don't believe he'll keep half the custom that I transferred with the mill." "A thousand dollars, clear profit, in so useful a business, ought to have satisfied you," said I. ...

Through the forward port the satellite could be seen with the naked eye, growing larger now and resolving itself into a tiny globe. To Carr it seemed that the diminutive moon winked provocatively as he turned to regard it without the rulden's aid. Off to the west, Saturn and her rings almost filled the sky, and their baleful light shone cold and menacing against the black velvet of the heavens. * * * * * Mado took the controls when the _Nomad_ entered the atmosphere of Titan and drifted over the sea of clouds. He corrected the altimeter for the mass of this body of three thousand miles diameter, and noted that they were up about six thousand feet.

> ... The necessity thereof is all the more imperative when we consider the growth of scepticism and materialism amongst the more intellectual classes, whilst the mass of the people have forsaken their blind faith only to succumb to religious indifference. To every awakened soul the question comes: Why does evil exist? So long as the enigma remains unsolved, Suffering remains a threatening sphinx, opposing God and ready to devour mankind. The key to the secret lies in Evolution, which can be accomplished only by means of the continual return of souls to earth. ...

It happened right below lawyer Varnum's, down at the bend of the Corbury road, just round about the time that Ruth got engaged to Ned Hale. The young folks was all friends, and I guess she just can't bear to talk about it. She's had troubles enough of her own." All the dwellers in Starkfield, as in more notable communities, had had troubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent to those of their neighbours; and though all conceded that Ethan Frome's had been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of the look in his face which, as I persisted in thinking, neither poverty nor physical suffering could have put there. ...

I visited the surgeon Parisot, the best and most benevolent of men; as also his beloved Godefroi, who had lived with him ten years, and whose merit chiefly consisted in her gentle manners and goodness of heart. It was impossible to see this woman without pleasure, or to leave her without regret. Nothing better shows the inclinations of a man, than the nature of his attachments. [Unless he be deceived in his choice, or that she, to whom he attaches himself, changes her character by an extraordinary concurrence of causes, which is not absolutely impossible. Were this consequence to be admitted without modification, Socrates must be judged of by his wife Xantippe, and Dion by his friend Calippus, which would be the most false and iniquitous judgment ever made. ...

"Is it important?" asked the counselor softly. "This happens to many people, you know, and some of them do find out who they were, with or without our help. But this is not simple amnesia. No one who's been retroed can resume his former identity. Of course, if we had tapes of the factors which made each person what he is...." He shrugged. "But those tapes don't exist. Who knows, really, what caused him to develop as he has? Most of it isn't at the conscious level. At best, if you should learn who you were, you'd have to pick up the thread of your former activities and acquaintances slowly and painfully.

"There is no one but you in the whole department who would forget the _dot_ and the expectations of Mademoiselle Beauvisage," said his sister. "She is the richest heiress in the department of the Aube," said Simon Giguet.

And then had come the sudden and terrible illness, and after weeks of anxiety everybody realized that if Mr. Laurie lived he would be fortunate, and that he would never be able to carry on any business at all. In what hushed tones the townspeople talked of the tragedy and how they speculated on what the Fernalds would do _now_. And how surprised the superintendent of one of the mills (who, by the way, had six husky boys of his own) had been to have Mr. Lawrence Fernald bridle with rage when he said he was sorry for him.

We lodged, if I remember rightly, at the "Golden Lion," where, for some reason, we were obliged to spend the following day and night. Walking along the streets in the afternoon, I fancied I saw the same young man whom I had formerly met at Passy. He was miserably dressed, and much paler than when I first saw him. He carried on his arm an old portmanteau, having only just arrived in the town. However, there was an expression in his countenance too amiable not to be easily recognised, and which immediately brought his features to my recollection. "Observe that young man," said I to the Marquis; "we must accost him." His joy was beyond expression when, in his turn, he recognised me. "Ah, sir! ...

Nothing, indeed, is lost by this sense of human propinquity; for all is exquisite. But the sign of appreciative humanity, residential or transient, is more than commonly strong. Yet Grasmere is a favourite haunt, too, of the serious pedestrian, not merely because it is beautiful, but because it is central. The lake tourist might be reasonably classified under four heads: the crag climbers, the strenuous walkers, the saunterers, and the roadsters. The first are a mere handful, for obvious reasons, and greatly affect Wastdale Head. The second are not very numerous, and seem on the decline. ...

S. Stribling, and Mark Twain are undisputed. Apart from fiction, the publications of both white and Negro writers are included throughout the bibliography.

Very likely the man only meant to frighten her and heap insults on her, for in '56, though wrath ran deep and strong, men waited. There was to be sudden, swift whelming when the time came, not intermittent outrage. But he had no time to do more than rein her pony back onto its haunches. There came a clatter of scurrying hoofs behind, and from a whirl of dust, topped by a rose-pink pugree, a steel blade swooped down on her and him. A surge of brown and pink and cream, and a dozen rainbow tints flashed past her; a long boot brushed her saddle on the off side. ...

Burton came up with the suggestion that perhaps the holes had been made by a disintegrator-ray. "It's possible," Allenby admitted. "This might have been the scene of some great battle--" "With only one such weapon?" I objected. Allenby swore as he stumbled. "What do you mean?"

The definition has scarcely De Quincey's usual verbal felicity, but we can apprehend the distinction he intended to make. It is to be noted also, and not with regard to Irving only, that the attention of young and old readers has been so occupied and distracted by the flood of new books, written with the single purpose of satisfying the wants of the day, produced and distributed with marvelous cheapness and facility that the standard works of approved literature remain for the most part unread upon the shelves.

"How many survivors are we?" asked Marjorie, sitting up in the water and looking about. "Four," responded Kitty; "but I won't swim. It makes my dress all greeny, and stubs my shoes out." Kitty was the only Maynard who was finicky about her clothes. It called forth much derision from her elder brother and sister, but she stood firm.

Leaving the letter where he had placed it, Gerty sat sipping her coffee while she looked up at him with the candid cynicism which lent a piquant charm to the almost doll-like regularity of her features. "You did not get three hours sleep and yet you're so fresh you smell of soap," she observed as an indignant protest, "while I've had six and I'm still too tired to move." "Oh, I'm all right--I never let myself get seedy," returned Perry, with his loud though pleasant laugh. "That's the mistake all you women make." Half closing her eyes Gerty leaned back and surveyed him with a curious detachment--almost as if he were an important piece of architecture which she had been recommended to admire and to which she was patiently trying in vain to adjust her baffled vision. The smaller she screwed her gaze the more remotely magnificent loomed his proportions. ...

Trop faible pour heurter en face Philippe le Bel, il trouva un moyen que lui eut envie, deux cents ans plus tard, le fondateur d'un ordre celebre: il pardonna hautement, publiquement a Colonna. Pardonner a Colonna, c'etait declarer Colonna coupable; les coupables seuls ont besoin de pardon. Si Colonna etait coupable, le roi de France etait au moins son complice. Il y avait quelque danger a soutenir un pareil argument; aussi Benoit XI ne fut-il pape que huit mois. ...

But I have sought long and far for these words, to utter an all but unutterable thought. When you walk in the forest you do not count the lives that you tread into nothingness. When you rejoice with the springtime you do not hear the cries of the young things that are choked and beaten down and dying. When you watch the wild thing in your snare you do not know the meaning of the torn limbs, and the throbbing heart, and the awful silence of the creature trapped. When you go where the poor live, and see thin faces and hungry eyes and crouching limbs, you do not think of these things either. But I, reader--I dwell in the Valley of the Shadow. ...

Milton, a sincere believer in God {13} if man ever were, must also at times have had his moments of beatific vision in which the invisible peace of God became more real than the storms of earthly life and the vileness of men. Indeed, we see the traces of such moments in the opening of _Comus_, in the concluding lines of _Lycidas_, in the sustained ecstasy of _At a Solemn Music_. But they appear to have been only moments. Milton was a lifelong Crusader who scarcely set foot in the Holy Land. The will of God meant for him not so much peace as war. He is a prophet rather than a psalmist. "Woe is me, my Mother, that thou hast born me a man of strife and contention," he himself complains in the _Reason of Church Government_. He was not much over thirty when he wrote those words: and they remained true of him to the end. ...

But Sylvia showed no curiosity and no pain. It was not the first time when people passed her mother that she had seen the man bow and the woman ignore. Rather she had come to expect it. She took her book from her berth and opened it. Mrs. Thesiger was satisfied. ...

They regarded disease with the apathy of creatures who felt it to be inseparable from humanity, and with the fatalism of despair. Gin was their cardinal prescription, not for cure, but for oblivion: "Sold everywhere." A score of palaces flourished within call of each other in that dismal district--garish, rich-looking dens, drawing to the support of their vulgar glory the means, the lives, the eternal destinies of the wrecked masses about them. Veritable wreckers they who construct these haunts, viler than the wretches who place false beacons and plunder bodies on the beach. Bring down the real owners of these places, and show them their deadly work! ...

A lucky shot that hit the end of the weapon arm and shattered it. Then he ran, and the Assassin followed. He ran in the direction he'd been heading, and gave himself up to terror. He was primaeval man fleeing from sabre-tooth. He was living a nightmare. His brain reeled, air burnt his lungs, and his pounding heart echoed in his temples.

Burr, understanding this, left in the mind of the apple-woman the firm impression that he thought she must have been at one time a duchess, reduced in fortune by some accident, and now driven to the last refuge of an apple-stand, and that those sad facts evidently accounted for the traits of high breeding and delicate refinement so visible through all her present poverty.

"Well," he said, "I think I could do with him, and the brass would be mighty useful to me just now; but how does the law stand? If it got to be talked about, the parish might come down upon me for the money." "That is so, John," one of the others said. "The best plan would be for you, and two of us, to go up to parson, and ask him how the matter stands. If he says that it is all right, you may be sure that you would be quite safe." The clergyman, upon being consulted, said that he thought the arrangement was a very good one. The parish authorities had not been asked to find any money for the father's funeral, and had therefore no say in the matter, unless they were called upon to take the child. ...

All the same it was a ring, and Job had a feeling that the manner of its discovery was romantic. Working for a milkman does not open up so rich a field of romance that any hints of the curious or remarkable can be suffered to pass unnoticed. The boy pondered the mystery of how the ring got into the barrel. For a moment he dallied with the notion that it might belong to his employer, who owned the barn and almost all the land within sight, and a prosperous milk-route down in Octavius. But no! Elisha Teachout was not a man given to rings; and even if he were, he assuredly would not have them of rubber. ...

But it was no longer possible to check this tendency, for, by force of circumstances, it had been planted in the very soul of every Russian who compared the conditions of life in his country with what European civilization had done for the neighboring countries. Excluded from journalism, this satiric tendency took refuge in literature, where the novel and the story trace the incidents of daily life. Since the writers could not touch the evil at its source, they showed its consequences for social life. They represented with eloquence the empty and deplorable banality of the existence forced upon most of them. By expressing in various ways general aspirations towards something better, they let literature continue its teaching, even in times particularly hostile to freedom of thought, like the reign of Nicholas I, the most typical and decided adversary of the freedom of the pen that Europe has ever seen. ...

At the very hour when Mr. Verner was summoning his son to his death-bed, at the precise time that military authority in India would have said, if asked, that Colonel Sir Lionel Verner could _not_ be spared, death had marked out that brave officer for his own especial prey. He fell in one of the skirmishes that took place near Moultan, and the two letters--one going to Europe with tidings of his death, the other going to India with news of his father's illness--crossed each other on the route. "Steevy," said old Mr. Verner to his younger son, after giving a passing lament to Sir Lionel, "I shall leave Verner's Pride to you." "Ought it not to go to the lad at Eton, father?" was the reply of Stephen Verner. "What's the lad at Eton to me?" cried the old man. ...

In the course of some private trials made by the builders, the consumption of coal was tested, with the result that while the vessel was going at a moderate speed the very low consumption of 14 lb. of coal per indicated horse power per hour was reached.

The word _plot_ here means the systematic plan or pattern into which the author weaves the events of the story up to some finishing point of intense interest or of great importance to the story. This vital part of the narrative is called the _climax_ or crucial point.

It was both full and long, meeting his cheeks at either end in a little dimple, and protruding above the lower lip.

A voyage on a big liner is a quite super-marine experience by comparison, with a picturesque and phosphorescent basis some distance below a sleepy deck-chair, and not necessarily observed at all. A battleship penetrates rather than sails the sea, and takes very little interest in keeping any part of herself dry. It is impossible to ignore the ocean on such a vessel. ...

We are using the Jandel locomotives on our electrified stretch of road. You know that patent?" "I know something about it, Mr. Bartholomew," said the younger inventor. "I have felt some interest in the electric locomotive, though I have done nothing practical in the matter. But I know the Jandel patent."

It is because this sublime principle of man has been constantly the object of the most scurrilous abuse, and the most detestable invective from superstition, that his moral existence has been buried in the gulf of ignorance, and his intellectual powers tarnished by the ferocious and impure hand of fanaticism. Although we are made capable of sublime reflections, it has hitherto been deemed a crime to think, and a still greater crime to speak our thoughts after they have been conceived. The despotism of the universe had waged war against the power of the human understanding, and for many ages successfully combated, his efforts, but the natural energy of this immortal property of human existence was incapable of being controlled by such, extraneous and degrading restraints. ...

Before setting this down, however, it should be said that the chief concern of the Devitts (excepting Harold) was to escape from the social orbit of successful industrialism, in which they moved, to the exalted spheres of county society. Their efforts, so far, had only taken them to certain halfway houses on their road. The families of consequence about Melkbridge were old-fashioned, conservative folk, who resented the intrusion in their midst of those they considered beneath them. ...

Although we were very strictly ruled during lessons, we ran rather wild after, and, looking back, I only wonder that no illness or accident ever befell us. Our dear Swiss nurse was often scandalised at our escapades, but our mother, bright and beautiful, loving music and landscape painting, and practising both with an amateur's enthusiasm, allowed us what she considered very salutary freedom after study. Still, I don't think she would have liked some of our wild doings and our consortings with Genoese peasant children and Surrey ploughboys, had she known of them. But, careful as she was of our physical and spiritual health, she trusted us and thought us unique. My memory goes back to the time when I was just able to walk and we dwelt in a typically English village near Cheltenham. ...

> ... Homer--I want an explanation." "An explanation of what?" "There is a person at the door who calls himself Bag Ears Mulligan. He has the audacity to claim you invited him to--to this _brawl_ as he terms it." I must here explain--with sorrow--that my Aunt Gretchen is a snob. There is no other term for it. It has gotten to be such a habit with her that any friend of mine is automatically a person to be looked down on. And Bag Ears Mulligan is one of my dearest friends. Of course I had invited him to my wedding, and felt honored by his attendance. Bag Ears is a habitue of one of the less glittering places I frequent in search of lasting fellowship--Red Nose Tessie's Bar, to be exact. A place of dirty beer glasses but of warm hearts and sincere people. "I'll see this man, Aunt Gretchen," I said with calm dignity. "He is to be an honored guest. While somewhat rugged in appearance, Bag Ears has a sensitive nature and must be treated with understanding. ...

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list, just a subway ride away.

You arrive at 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, in Manhattan, and find yourself on the steps of Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.

> ... It wouldn't be anything to him. Mamma says she is sure that he will relent some day." Nancy shrugged her shoulders. To her mind, it was foolish of her mother to put any hopes on the whims of an old eccentric. Mrs. Prescott was one of those poor optimists who believe earnestly in the miracles of chance, always forgetting that chance works its miracles as a rule only when the way has been prepared for them by the plodding labor of common sense. "We mustn't count on that, Alma," she said soberly. "There is no use in living on the possibility that Uncle Thomas will relent, and make us rich. It isn't just for the pure love of money that he has been so stingy toward us, I believe. He was never a miser toward Father, you know. I--I think he would have given us everything in the world if--if----" She hesitated, unwilling to state her private opinion to Alma. "If what? ...

> ... Nor was it a pleasant journey, for, if the masters of the situation above had made any mistake, I should have been dashed to pieces. Also, the bats continually flew into my face and clung to my hair, and I have a great dislike of bats. At last, after some minutes of jerking and dangling, I found myself standing in a narrow passage by the side of the worthy Ali, covered with bats and perspiration, and with the skin rubbed off my knees and knuckles. Then another man came down, hand over hand like a sailor, and as the rest were told to stop above we were ready to go on. Ali went first with his candle--of course we each had a candle--leading the way down a long passage about five feet high. At length the passage widened out, and we were in the tomb-chamber: I think the hottest and most silent place that I ever entered. It was simply stifling. This chamber is a square room cut in the rock and totally devoid of paintings or sculpture. ...

You arrive at 2085 Honeywell Avenue, in the Bronx, and find yourself on the steps of West Farms Library.

You approach a librarian at the reference desk. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*Life and Death, and Other Legends and Stories*.'

The people who had come to the shore with loud conversation and clamor grew silent at sight of those lily-colored, motionless spaces, and whispered: "What quiet! How everything rests there in clearness!" "Oh, yes, there is rest and unbroken repose in that region." So some, namely, those who were weariest, said after a silence: "Let us find the sleep which is surely unbroken." And they entered the water. The rainbow-hued surface opened straightway before them, as if wishing to lighten the passage. Those who remained on the shore began now to call after them, but no man turned his head, and all hurried forward with willingness and lightly, attracted more and more by the charm of that wonderful region. ...

Since that time some of the Johnson boys and girls have bought and sold and swapped portions of the land. But most of it is still in the hands of the Johnson boys and girls or their sons and daughters. After farming in Fisher County in the year of 1898, Papa moved to a farm in Jones County, a mile northeast of Neinda, and farmed there in 1899. And there, in a half-dugout, my sister, Susie, was born. Many years later as we would drive by the farm in our hack, on our way to church at Neinda, our parents would point out the old dugout and explain, "There is where we used to live. ...

This charming book has passed through many editions, but its author, of her own choice, remained almost unknown. The "Dictionary of National Biography" has strangely passed her by. Almost all that her wishes suffer us to know is that she was sister of Mr. William Oke Manning, to whom she affectionately dedicated the fourth edition of the book which is now reprinted; that she was never married; and that she was a genuine student and an indefatigable writer on historical and literary subjects. In "Mary Powell" she touched the heart of her generation, and few books of its day had a wider circulation. "The Household of Sir Thomas More" is a still more painstaking study, and a more complete and delightful portrait. ...
