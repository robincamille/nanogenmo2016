# If on a winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was an extraordinary book. You haven't thought about it in years, though, until this afternoon, when you remembered the book in a moment of drowsiness. *That book!* What was it called? Alas! You have forgotten the title.

But you feel sure that you could recognize it by sight, or at least in reading the first few pages. And surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. You must find it; you must read it. It's only 4:00. You have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the nearest library branch.

___

You arrive at 2900 Broadway, in Manhattan, and find yourself on the steps of Morningside Heights Library.

You approach a kindly librarian and ask him about the book you're seeking. 'I think it had a red cover,' you add hopefully.

His eyes light up. 'Ah! You must mean *Romain Rolland: The Man and His Work*.' He leads you to the book and plucks it from the shelf. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... HOeLDERLIN. ROMAIN ROLLAND CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY The first fifty years of Romain Rolland's life were passed in inconspicuous and almost solitary labors. Thenceforward, his name was to become a storm center of European discussion. Until shortly before the apocalyptic year, hardly an artist of our days worked in such complete retirement, or received so little recognition. Since that year, no artist has been the subject of so much controversy. His fundamental ideas were not destined to make themselves generally known until there was a world in arms bent upon destroying them. Envious fate works ever thus, interweaving the lives of the great with tragical threads. She tries her powers to the uttermost upon the strong, sending events to run counter to their plans, permeating their lives with strange allegories, imposing obstacles in their path--that they may be guided more unmistakably in the right course. ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You board a bus headed toward another nearby library branch.

You arrive at 100-01 Northern Boulevard, in Corona, and find yourself on the steps of Langston Hughes Library.

As you walk through the stacks, you bump into a tall woman. 'Excuse me,' you murmur. 'I was just looking for a book.'

She smiles politely and shelves the book she was holding. It's red and looks familiar... *The Lion's Brood*, it's called. You take it down from the shelf.

> ... Once the magistrate's lips moved, but no words came from them, and strange noises, as of the clenching of teeth and sharp, quick breathing, rose all about. Then a voice came from his mouth, the very calmness of which seemed terrible:-- "Quirites, we have been beaten in a great battle. Our army is destroyed, and Caius Flaminius, the consul, is killed. ...

You close the book, disappointed. This is not the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library. You set off for the next branch on your list.

You arrive at 1000 Utica Avenue, in Brooklyn, and find yourself on the steps of Rugby Library.

You approach a librarian at the reference desk. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*Sinopah the Indian Boy*.'

> ... The feast was soon over. No one was really hungry and only a very small portion of the food was eaten. The old medicine man, I-kus-kin-i, or Low Horn, by name, had brought his own pipe, and now filled and lighted it and passed it around. He knew why he had been invited to the lodge, but for all that it was White Wolf's duty to tell the reason for the gathering of relatives, and so the chief made a little speech. "Relatives and friends," he said, "soon after the sun came in sight this morning, he looked down and saw my new-born boy. Before he goes out of sight to his lodge to-night, I think it right that he should know the new-born's name. So it is that I have asked you all to gather here. I call upon our old friend Low Horn to say what the name shall be, and I now make him a small present: Low Horn, in my band of horses grazing out yonder on the plain is a certain four-year-old black-and-white pinto. I give him to you. ...

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list, just a subway ride away.

"And wherefore did you refuse him? he was an honest man they say; and a comely; and he would have kept you and your mother far better than you ever can yourself, for all your spinning and silk winding. " "We are so poor! " she said passionately; "and mother has been ill so long, we should have become a burthen to him;--and then I never should have done for a Signora. When his friends came to see him, he would only have been ashamed of me. " "How can you say so? I tell you the man was good and kind;--he would even have been willing to settle in Sorrento. ...

You arrive at 4020 Broadway, in Long Island City, and find yourself on the steps of Broadway Library.

You browse the shelves and find yourself attracted to a book entitled *The Flying Mercury*. Is this the one you've been looking for? 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... "Get your friend aboard. " Lestrange was already in his seat, waiting. "What's that for? " asked the dazed guest, as, on taking his place, a strap was slipped around his waist, securing him to the seat. "So you won't fall out," soothed the grinning Rupert. "You ain't well, you know. Not that I'd care if you did, but somebody might blame Darling. " The car leaped forward, gathering speed to an extent that was a revelation in motoring to Ffrench. The keen air, the giddy rush through the dark, were a sobering tonic. After a while he spoke to the man beside him, nervously embarrassed by a situation he was beginning to appreciate. "This is a racing car? " "It was. " "Isn't it now? " "If I were going to race it day after to-morrow, I wouldn't be risking it over a country road to-night. A racing machine is petted like a race-horse until it is wanted. " "And then? " "It takes its chances. ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You board a bus headed toward another nearby library branch.

> ... The Catholic church complains of a general defection. The majority of the Christian church confesses that the Protestant Reformation was not a revival of religion, not a "Great awakening," but a great falling to sleep; the faith of Luther and Calvin was a great decline of religion--a decline of piety in the ecclesiastical form; that modern philosophy, the physics of Galileo and Newton, the metaphysics of Descartes and of Kant, mark another decline of religion--a decline of piety in the philosophical form; that all the modern democracy of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, marks a yet further decline of religion--a decline of piety in the political form; that all the modern secular societies, for removing the evils of men and their sins, mark a yet fourth decline of religion--a decline of piety in the philanthropic form. ...

> ... It is fair to remember, too, that much of the painter's work was done under certain disadvantages inherent in the times of his activity. With the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, costume was stiff and ugly to an extreme that excites our laughter now. The age of artificiality was upon land, and Sir Thomas Lawrence was not so well equipped for making the best of it as were Reynolds and Gainsborough, who came immediately before him. That he succeeded so often in making the personality of a sitter overcome the absurdities of dress and decoration is an eloquent tribute to his art. ...

> ... We do the same, of course, but--look! " He pointed to the large deliberate smoke-heads renewing themselves along that yellowed beach. "That is the frontier of civilization. They have all civilization against them --those brutes yonder. It's not the local victories of the old wars that we're after. It's the barbarian--all the barbarian. Now, you've seen the whole thing in little. Come and look at our children. " SOLDIERS IN CAVES We left that tall tree whose fruits are death ripened and distributed at the tingle of small bells. The observer returned to his maps and calculations; the telephone-boy stiffened up beside his exchange as the amateurs went out of his life. Some one called down through the branches to ask who was attending to--Belial, let us say, for I could not catch the gun's name. It seemed to belong to that terrific new voice which had lifted itself for the second or third time. ...

This doesn't sound familiar at all. Frowning, you leave the book on a reshelving cart and stride out into the evening air, ready to try another library branch. Maybe your luck will change.

> ... As to transpiration taking place in a saturated atmosphere, it is a mistake; generally there is a difference in the temperature of the plant and the air, and the air is not saturated in its vicinity. In a word, transpiration and evaporation is the same thing. Herr Reinke has made an interesting examination of the action of light on a plant. He has permitted a pencil of sun rays to pass through a converging lens upon a cell containing a fragment of an aquatic plant. He was enabled to increase the intensity of the light, so that it should be stronger or weaker than the direct sunlight. He could thus vary its intensity from 1/16 of that of direct sunlight to an intensity 64 times stronger. The temperature was maintained constant. ...

No, this isn't the book you had in mind, although it does intrigue you. You consider checking it out, but you don't have much time before the next branch closes. You go outside and point your feet toward the next branch on your list.

" how would they know what I wanted? ' 'Oh, of course I should have my name on the cover,' Soames answered earnestly. 'And I rather want,' he added, looking hard at Rothenstein, 'to have a drawing of myself as frontispiece. ' Rothenstein admitted that this was a capital idea, and mentioned that he was going into the country and would be there for some time. He then looked at his watch, exclaimed at the hour, paid the waiter, and went away with me to dinner. Soames remained at his post of fidelity to the glaucous witch. 'Why were you so determined not to draw him? ' I asked. 'Draw him? Him? How can one draw a man who doesn't exist? ' 'He is dim,' I admitted. But my mot juste fell flat. Rothenstein repeated that Soames was non-existent. ...

"If what the man says be true, father will be only too glad to help an old brother-officer in misfortune, and be sorry to see him in such a plight.

"So this is the way? " cried the man. "Yes: the castle is up there," and Ralph pointed. "What! in ruins? " cried the captain. "Ruins? No! " cried Ralph. "Those stones are natural; the top of the cliff. Our place is behind them. They do look like ruins, though. " "Hah! But what an eagle's nest. No wonder I find an eaglet on my way. ...

He returned to the interior of the hut, curled himself again on the ashes, and weakly resolving to sleep until moonrise, and as weakly hesitating, ended by falling into uneasy but helpless stupor. When he awoke, the rising sun, almost level with the low entrance to the sweat-house, was darting its direct rays into the interior, as if searching it with fiery spears. He had slept ten hours. He rose tremblingly to his knees. Everything was quiet without; he might yet escape. He crawled to the opening. The open space before it was empty, but the scaffolding was gone. The clear, keen air revived him. As he sprang out, erect, a shout that nearly stunned him seemed to rise from the earth on all sides. He glanced around him in a helpless agony of fear. ...

"Here, play me this," said he, opening my Beethoven at the adagio of the sonata, _Quasi una fantasia_. "Let us see how you play," he continued, taking his cup of tea to drink in a corner of the room. I know not why, but I felt it would be impossible either to refuse or to put forward a plea of playing badly; on the contrary, I submissively sat down at the piano and began to play as well as I could, although I was afraid of his criticism, knowing his excellent taste in music. ...

Would that certain other acquaintances of mine were similarly receiving beneficent attention! Walking proved an easy enough task, for I seemed to be borne on air, while a chorus of pleasant thoughts, of many-coloured recollections, kept singing gently in my breast--a chorus resembling, indeed, the white-maned billows in the regularity with which now it rose, and now it fell, to reveal in, as it were, soft, peaceful depths the bright, supple hopes of youth, like so many silver fish cradled in the bosom of the ocean. ...

Doubtless those women who flee from the insidious assault lead lives more estimable than those who succumb, but they do not learn the gentle art of coquetry in its Parisian form. So much the better for the quietude of Boston and Kansas City and Glasgow and Tewkesbury. It is probable, highly probable, that the foreigner who recklessly remains in Paris and invites the spirit of the place will show her inevitable lapse from Puritanical grace first in her underwear. French lingerie is the sign and symbol of French femininity. It is the refinement of luxury, the quintessence of coquetry. ...

This did better; still, I was disappointed in the appearance they made, and a good deal displeased with myself. I felt that I had made a bad bargain--that is, one from which I should obtain no real pleasure. For a while I sat opposite the mantle-piece, looking at the vases--but, not admiringly; then I left the parlor, and went about my household duties, but, with a pressure on my feelings. I was far, very far from being satisfied with myself. About an hour afterwards my husband came home. I did not take him into the parlor to show him my little purchase, for, I had no heart to do so. As we sat at the tea table, he said, addressing me-- "You know that old coat of mine that is up in the clothes-press? " I nodded my head in assent, but did not venture to speak. ...

The more perfect the photoplay, the less the need for all such explanatory material, as is the case in perfect pantomime.

The title, "FIFTEEN YEARS IN HELL," may, to some, seem irreverent or profane, but let me assure any such that it is the mildest I can find which conveys an idea of the facts. Expect nothing ornate or romantic. The path along which you who walk with me will go is not a flowery one. Its shadows are those of the cypress and yew; its skies are curtained with funereal clouds; its beginning is a gloom and its end is a mad house. But go with me, for you can suffer no harm, and a knowledge of what you will see may lead you to warn others who are in danger of doing as I have done. Unless help comes to me from on high, I feel that I am near the end of my weary and sorrow-laden pilgrimage on earth. ...

The 36th brigade was on the left of the division and had moved forward early in the morning, accompanied by Barnett's 2nd Illinois battery, and occupied its position. The 85th Illinois, Colonel Moore, was deployed upon the right, and the 52nd Ohio on the left. The 125th Illinois, Colonel Harmon, was held as a reserve, and the 86th Illinois was on the picket line. At an early hour the rebel skirmishers opened a sharp fire on the 86th, and although this was the first fight in which, it was ever engaged, it advanced steadily upon them and drove them back in confusion with severe loss. Irritated at the loss of their position, the rebels massed upon the right and left, and commenced a furious fire from their batteries upon the brigade. The firing continued for an hour, but the brigade resolutely held its ground. ...

Encountering difficulties he would become more and more uneasy as to that point, until at last he would have detached a scout to make sure. But mark this further: The party's informants had told Hubbard that he would find the river easily navigable for eighteen miles. ...

The ventilation was very satisfactory, and we got sufficient fresh air. ...

The fact of his being "gone" on their Emily is, of itself, naturally sufficient to stamp him as an imbecile in the eyes of Emily's brothers and sisters. The father finds him slow, and thinks the girl might have done better; while the best that his future mother-in-law (his sole supporter) can say for him is, that he seems steady. There is only one thing that prompts the family to tolerate him, and that is the reflection that he is going to take Emily away from them. On that understanding they put up with him. ...

Its massive proportions, the stately pose of its furrowed trunk and the graceful outlines of its drooping branches have often drawn my pleased eyes and awakened admiration. There is nothing in Nature that better serves to stir up human enthusiasm than a fine tree; and as our vicinage for miles around abounds in worthy examples of American forest growths, there is ample opportunity for such sentiment to be kept aglow in the hearts of the Tenants at the Old Farm. Yet it must be confessed that there is also occasion at times for a kindling of quite another sort, when the stupidity, perversity, and penuriousness of men wage a vandal war against the noble monarchs of the woods. ...

It was the dusk of an evening in mid spring. Above, the sky was clear, washed by the rain that had fallen without intermission since early morning.

Oh! they were dressed very splendidly, and if their faces had been kind, they would have looked beautiful. But their faces were full of pride and hate. The sheriff was looking everywhere with spiteful glances for Robin Hood, and very cross he was that he did not see Robin there. But Robin was there, though the sheriff did not see him. There he stood in his ragged beggar's garments, not ten feet away from the sheriff. The targets were placed eighty yards from where the archers were to stand. Pace that off, and see what a great distance it is. There were a great number of archers to shoot and each was to have one shot. ...

For the king issued the proclamation in the interest of the western Indians (and the annuities he received when the fur trade was prosperous) who desired that the West should be preserved to them. But what could be said if Virginia purchased the Indian's claim? Could a king's proclamation keep the Virginians from a territory to which, for value received, the Indians had given a quit-claim deed? This famous Treaty of Fort Stanwix was held in the fall of 1768. Three thousand Indians were present. Presents were lavished upon the chieftains. The western boundary line crossed from the west branch of the Susquehanna to Kittanning on the Allegheny River; it followed the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers southwest to the mouth of the Great Kanawha. ...

Before he could pull up his excited horse, there was a sudden rush from the French lines. Several young nobles and gentlemen had recognized the Duke, had taken in the accidental isolation of his position, and galloping forward with one consent, surrounded him before he was well aware what had happened. ...

> ... '[3] William James expresses his mind thus: 'In broadest and most general terms possible, one might say that religious life consists in the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. This belief and this adjustment are the religious attitude of the soul. In the ordinary sense of the word, however, no attitude is accounted religious unless it be grave and serious; the trifling, sneering attitude of a Voltaire must be thrown out if we would not strain the ordinary use of language. Moreover, there must be something solemn, serious, and tender about any attitude which we denominate Religion. If glad, it must not grin or snigger; if sad, it must not scream or curse. ...

Having been the wealthiest of the Earth's nations, the Americans continued with their early nuclear war survival plans, designated as "Proposition Blue". It was this proposal that expedited the construction and populating of those cities named the Omega Sub-Ground Installations: (O.S.G.I's). Constructed near more populous areas and connected by underground pneumatic travel tubes, each city was designed to host some one thousand individuals made up of the chosen elite. ...

Not every mother will find it possible to carry out all the suggestions offered in this little book, but no one should feel discouraged on that account. It seemed best to offer too many suggestions rather than too few, because these pages may fall into the hands of some mothers whose situation is such that full advantage can be taken of every idea here given. Presence of too much matter in the little book will not destroy its usefulness in cases where only a portion can be applied, whereas the lack of some of the ideas might limit its value in certain instances. ...

The moon had sunk, but her light still silvered the mountains that stand at watch round Chiavenna; and the castle rock was flat and black against that dreamy background. Jupiter, who walked so lately for us on the long ridge of the Jacobshorn above our pines, had now an ample space of sky over Lombardy to light his lamp in. Why is it, we asked each other, as we smoked our pipes and strolled, my friend and I;--why is it that Italian beauty does not leave the spirit so untroubled as an Alpine scene? Why do we here desire the flower of some emergent feeling to grow from the air, or from the soil, or from humanity to greet us? ...

The characteristic which distinguishes this second part of the Gospel is, that Jesus no longer manifests His glory to the people in signs of manifest power, but now, in chapters xiii.-xvii., further discloses His glory privately to the Twelve; and in chapters xviii. and xix. passes triumphantly through the ultimate trial which still lay between Him and the final consummation of His glory. ...

This process of feeling is so natural, that it may be observed even in children, who cannot endure that a nursery story should be repeated to them differently from the manner in which it was first told. But without altering, in the slightest degree, either the story or the mode of telling it, the Author has taken this opportunity to correct errors of the press and slips of the pen. That such should exist cannot be wondered at, when it is considered that the Publishers found it their interest to hurry through the press a succession of the early editions of the various Novels, and that the Author had not the usual opportunity of revision. It is hoped that the present edition will be found free from errors of that accidental kind. ...

In short, as Mrs White told Jem that evening, Mrs Leigh was "that set" on the name that she had to give in to her.

> ... But the pretty story of the beggar-maiden, Rachel, and her suitors, Jonson found, not among the classics, but in the ideals of romantic love which Shakespeare had already popularised on the stage. Jonson never again produced so fresh and lovable a feminine personage as Rachel, although in other respects "The Case is Altered" is not a conspicuous play, and, save for the satirising of Antony Munday in the person of Antonio Balladino and Gabriel Harvey as well, is perhaps the least characteristic of the comedies of Jonson. "Every Man in His Humour," probably first acted late in the summer of 1598 and at the Curtain, is commonly regarded as an epoch-making play; and this view is not unjustified. As to plot, it tells little more than how an intercepted letter enabled a father to follow his supposedly studious son to London, and there observe his life with the gallants of the time. ...

From the interior there were clamours for troops to be massed on the Northern frontier, and from the seaboard cities there came a cry for ships that were worthy to be called men-of-war,--ships to defend the harbours and bays, ships to repel an invasion by sea. Suggestions were innumerable. There was no time to build, it was urged; the Government could call upon friendly nations. But wise men smiled sadly at these suggestions; it was difficult to find a nation desirous of a war with England. In the midst of the enthusiasms, the fears, and the suggestions, came reports of the capture of American merchantmen by fast British cruisers. These reports made the American people more furious, the American Government more anxious. Almost from the beginning of this period of national turmoil, a party of gentlemen met daily in one of the large rooms in a hotel in New York. ...

This conception brings life into line with other catalytic actions, and shows us a living being as a store of potential energy, to be set free by an external stimulus which may also excite sensation. In a subsequent chapter I have dealt with the rise of Synthetic Biology, whose history and methods I have described. It is only of late that the progress of physico-chemical science has enabled us to enter into this field of research, the final one in the evolution of biological science. ...

> ... Between ignorance of what they might say and what I might receive, my correspondents confined themselves to business discussions and bald family history. My brother wrote of his son Archie's death in the retreat from Mons; my niece Yolande Manisty told me that she and her husband had moved into my house in Pont Street and were attending to my affairs as best they might. A further letter brought me the shocking news of Deryk Lancing's death on the eve of war, with consequences to myself which I required many weeks to digest.... After that there were guarded and bewildered little notes from Felix Manisty, who is a greater archaeologist than man of affairs; there were voluminous technical enquiries from Hatherly, my solicitor, a weekly budget from Yolande and sporadic outbursts from friends who had heard of my internment and felt constrained to write one letter to cheer my loneliness. ...

In the spring of the year nearly all the robust male adults, and occasionally females, repaired to a surgeon to be bled, a process which they considered essentially conduced to vigorous health. " The charge for the operation was one shilling. Parliament was petitioned, in 1542, praying that surgeons might be exempt from bearing arms and serving on juries, and thus be enabled without hindrance to attend to their professional duties. The request was granted, and to the present time medical men enjoy the privileges granted so long ago. In 1745, the surgeons and the barbers separated by Act of Parliament. ...

He entered the Dominican order when a boy, but had a free and eager appetite for knowledge. He urged, like Bacon, that Nature should be studied through her own works, not through books; he attacked, like Bacon, the dead faith in Aristotle, that instead of following his energetic spirit of research, lapsed into blind idolatry. Campanella strenuously urged that men should reform all sciences by following Nature and the books of God. He had been stirring in this way for ten years, when there arose in Calabria a conspiracy against the Spanish rule. ...

But, in order to enable you to provide for the wants of yourself and your family, without the unhappy necessity of exercising your fatal office, you shall receive every year the sum of two hundred dinars. " In this way all the officers and servants of the palace passed before the notice of the prince; he interrogated each on the nature of his occupation and his past services, on his means of existence, and on the salary which he received. ...

No, this isn't the book you had in mind, although it does intrigue you. You consider checking it out, but you don't have much time before the next branch closes. You go outside and point your feet toward the next branch on your list.

You arrive at 214-20 Northern Boulevard, in Bayside, and find yourself on the steps of Bayside Library.

While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the red cloth-covered book that fell on you. '*The Zeit-Geist*,' you mutter. It looks familiar. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... The God that he tells them of is a fiction of his imagination; indeed, I might say a mere creature of his fancy, who is going to save all men in the end, whatever they do! " "A Universalist! " "Oh, worse than that--at least, I have read the books of Universalists who, though their error was great, did not appear to me so far astray. I cannot understand it! I cannot understand it! " he went on; "I cannot understand the influence that he has obtained over our more educated class; for twenty years ago he was himself a low, besotted drunkard, and his wife is the daughter of a murderer! Still less do I understand how such people can claim to be religious at all, and yet not see to what awful evil the small beginnings of vice must lead. ...

You stop reading. This isn't your book, this is some other strange text. It bothers you for some reason. You leave it on the shelf and go outside, taking calming breaths. Time to try the next library branch.

___

You arrive at 380 Washington Avenue, in Brooklyn, and find yourself on the steps of Clinton Hill Library.

You browse the shelves and find yourself attracted to a book entitled *The Boy Allies at Liège; Or, Through Lines of Steel*. Is this the one you've been looking for?

> ... As the two boys rounded the corner, the cry for help again went up. "Come on, Chester! " shouted Hal. "We can't let that gang of hoodlums beat up anyone who speaks the English language. " "Lead on! " cried Chester. "I am right with you! " They were upon the crowd as he spoke, and Hal's right fist shot out with stinging force, and the nearest assailant, struck on the side of the neck, fell to the ground with a groan. "Good work, Hal! " shouted Chester, at the same time wading into the crowd of young ruffians, for such the attackers proved to be, and striking out right and left. Howls of anger and imprecations greeted the attack from this unexpected source, and for a moment the ruffians fell back. ...

This doesn't sound familiar at all. Frowning, you leave the book on a reshelving cart and stride out into the evening air, ready to try another library branch. Maybe your luck will change.

___

You arrive at 4790 Broadway, in Manhattan, and find yourself on the steps of Inwood Library.

You approach a librarian at the reference desk. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*By Conduct and Courage: A Story of the Days of Nelson*.'

> ... John himself is a kind-hearted chap, and would treat him well, and in a few years the boy would make a useful nipper on board his boat. " John Hammond was sent for, and the case was put to him. "Well," he said, "I think I could do with him, and the brass would be mighty useful to me just now; but how does the law stand? If it got to be talked about, the parish might come down upon me for the money. " "That is so, John," one of the others said. "The best plan would be for you, and two of us, to go up to parson, and ask him how the matter stands. If he says that it is all right, you may be sure that you would be quite safe. " The clergyman, upon being consulted, said that he thought the arrangement was a very good one. The parish authorities had not been asked to find any money for the father's funeral, and had therefore no say in the matter, unless they were called upon to take the child. ...

You arrive at 4207 18th Avenue, in Brooklyn, and find yourself on the steps of Kensington Library.

While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the red cloth-covered book that fell on you. '*Annouchka: A Tale*,' you mutter. It looks familiar. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... I learned that Gaguine was travelling, like myself, for pleasure, and that, having arrived about a week ago at L., he had settled himself there for the time being. I must confess I do not like to become intimate with Russians in a foreign country. As far as I can see them, I easily recognize their walk, the cut of their clothes, principally the expression of their face. This expression, supercilious and scornful in its nature, at times imperious, suddenly assumes a cautious and even a timid air. They appear seized with a kind of restlessness; their eyes disclose a strange anxiety: "Seigneur! have I not said something foolish; are they laughing at me by chance? " their look seems to ask. Then one sees them again assume their majestic calmness, until a new feeling of uneasiness comes to trouble them. Yes, I say it again, I avoid all intercourse with my fellow-countrymen; nevertheless, at first sight, I felt attracted towards Gaguine. ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You board a bus headed toward another nearby library branch.

___

You arrive at 4355 Katonah Avenue, in the Bronx, and find yourself on the steps of Woodlawn Heights Library.

You walk every aisle, but nothing looks promising. Suddenly, a young woman rushes past you, and a book falls out of her bag. 'Hey!' you call after her, but she has already left. You pick up the book and read the title: *Washington Irving*. It has a red cover and a familiar weight in your hand. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... Besides this, and with respect to Irving in particular, there has been in America a criticism--sometimes called the destructive, sometimes the Donnybrook Fair--that found "earnestness" the only amusing thing in the world, that brought to literary art the test of utility, and disparaged what is called the "Knickerbocker School" (assuming Irving to be the head of it) as wanting in purpose and virility, a merely romantic development of the post-Revolutionary period. And it has been to some extent the fashion to damn with faint admiration the pioneer if not the creator of American literature as the "genial" Irving. Before I pass to an outline of the career of this representative American author, it is necessary to refer for a moment to certain periods, more or less marked, in our literature. ...

You arrive at 69-70 Grand Avenue, in Maspeth, and find yourself on the steps of Maspeth Library.

While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the red cloth-covered book that fell on you. '*A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court*,' you mutter. It looks familiar. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... Now by my faith I know well that he will grieve some of the court of King Arthur; for on him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I, and that will beguile them; and because of his armor and shield I am sure I shall ride in peace. And then soon after departed Sir Kay, and thanked his host. As I laid the book down there was a knock at the door, and my stranger came in. I gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him welcome. I also comforted him with a hot Scotch whisky; gave him another one; then still another--hoping always for his story. After a fourth persuader, he drifted into it himself, in a quite simple and natural way: THE STRANGER'S HISTORY I am an American. I was born and reared in Hartford, in the State of Connecticut--anyway, just over the river, in the country. ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You board a bus headed toward another nearby library branch.

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

When yer feelin' comfortable, yer can't understand why the devil we ain't comfortable. " "Well, why the devil ain't yer? " demanded Mike. "I ain't takin' all the shade er all the earth, am I? Lie down and be quiet. What do yer want a beauty show for? " "Aw, stow it! " snapped the Watermelon. "Yes, I'll stow it all right when we're all sent to the jug. I tell yer I ain't fit to work. The last time I got pinched, I pretty near croaked. I wasn't made to work. " "We ain't going to get pinched," said James. "You make more talk over two suits of clothes--" "It ain't the clothes. It's the damn fool notion of swipin' 'em and then comin' right back here, and not makin' no get-away--" "This hang-out is more than four miles from the burg, you galoot," sneered the Watermelon. ...

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list, just a subway ride away.

___

You arrive at 38-23 104 Street, in Corona, and find yourself on the steps of Corona Library.

You browse the shelves and find yourself attracted to a book entitled *Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Volume 68, No. 417, July, 1850*. Is this the one you've been looking for? 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... At his death, Louis XII. had left all things prepared for an Italian campaign; and Francis, eager to signalise his accession by the recovery of the Milanese, moved southwards in the month of August 1515, at the head of the finest troops that had yet crossed the boundary line between France and Italy. His army consisted of fifteen thousand excellent cavalry, twenty-two thousand lansquenets, fourteen thousand French and Gascon infantry, besides pioneers and a numerous artillery. The Constable of Bourbon led the van, the Duke of Alencon commanded the rear; Francis himself headed the main body, accompanied by Duke Anthony of Lorraine, (eldest brother of Guise,) with Bayard for his lieutenant, and by the Duke of Gueldres, captain-general of the lansquenets, whose lieutenant was the Count de Guise. If the army was good, none, assuredly, ever reckoned greater warriors amongst its leaders. ...

You close the book, disappointed. This is not the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library. You set off for the next branch on your list.

You arrive at 2385 Ralph Avenue, in Brooklyn, and find yourself on the steps of Mill Basin Library.

You walk every aisle, but nothing looks promising. Suddenly, a young woman rushes past you, and a book falls out of her bag. 'Hey!' you call after her, but she has already left. You pick up the book and read the title: *Varney the Vampire; Or, the Feast of Blood*. It has a red cover and a familiar weight in your hand. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... CHAPTER XCI.--THE GRAND CONSULTATION BROKEN UP BY MRS. CHILLINGWORTH, AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VARNEY. CHAPTER XCII.--THE MISADVENTURE OF THE DOCTOR WITH THE PICTURE. CHAPTER XCIII.--THE ALARM AT ANDERBURY.--THE SUSPICIONS OF THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY, AND THE MYSTERIOUS COMMUNICATION. CHAPTER XCIV.--THE VISITOR, AND THE DEATH IN THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE. CHAPTER XCV.--THE MARRIAGE IN THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY ARRANGED. CHAPTER XCVI.--THE BARON TAKES ANDERBURY HOUSE, AND DECIDES UPON GIVING A GRAND ENTERTAINMENT. PREFACE The unprecedented success of the romance of "Varney the Vampyre," leaves the Author but little to say further, than that he accepts that success and its results as gratefully as it is possible for any one to do popular favours. ...

You close the book, disappointed. This is not the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library. You set off for the next branch on your list.

You arrive at 1215 Morrison Avenue, in the Bronx, and find yourself on the steps of Clason's Point Library.

As soon as you enter, you see a familiar-looking red book on display in an exhibit. You snatch it up and read the title: *Janet McLaren, the Faithful Nurse*. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... In the same way she took upon herself the arrangement and expense of the funeral. She sold the goods and chattels, as her master had directed her to do, for the benefit of his children; but they were old and worn, and the purchasers were few and poor, so that the proceeds placed but a very limited sum in Janet's hands for the maintenance of the little ones. As she received them she observed, "It's as muckle as I could ha' hoped for; but yet those who had benefited by his ministrations might have shown their gratitude by geeing a trifle above the value for the chattels. " Human nature is much the same in an Highland glen as it is in other parts of the world. The day arrived when Janet and her charges must quit the manse. ...

You arrive at 200 Clarke Avenue, in Staten Island, and find yourself on the steps of Richmondtown Library.

As you walk through the stacks, you bump into a tall woman. 'Excuse me,' you murmur. 'I was just looking for a book.'

She smiles politely and shelves the book she was holding. It's red and looks familiar... *The Man in Lonely Land*, it's called. You take it down from the shelf. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... "Do you enjoy yourself when you stay at home? " "I enjoy myself much more at home than in other people's houses. Where are you going to-night? " "To the Warings. There'll be cards after dinner. I suppose you declined. " "I wasn't invited. " "Hilda wanted you, but knew it was useless. " Again the big blue eyes were raised to her brother's. "What makes you so horrid, Winthrop? If you go on ignoring people as you do--" "I'll have to have paid pall-bearers at my funeral, won't I? Not a bad idea. Well, why this summons to-night? " Mrs. Warrick pressed the last button of her glove securely, eased her skirt over her hips, and sat down carefully. "To ask you to do something for me," she said. "Channing won't be back until to-morrow, and there is no one to meet her except Decker if you don't. ...

You arrive at 250-06 Hillside Avenue, in Bellerose, and find yourself on the steps of Bellerose Library.

While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the red cloth-covered book that fell on you. '*Brittany*,' you mutter. It looks familiar. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... They live differently from the sleepy villagers--these strapping giants of the sea, with their deep-toned faces, their hair made tawny by exposure, their blue eyes, which somehow or other seem so very blue against the dark red-brown of their complexion, their reckless, rollicking, yet graceful, sailor's gait. A sailor always reminds me of a cat amongst a roomful of crockery: he looks as if he will knock over something or trip over something every moment as he swings along in his careless fashion; yet he never does. Illustration: HOMEWARD BOUND] What a contrast they are, these stalwart fishers of the deep, to the somewhat pallid, dapper-looking, half-French hotel and shop keepers, who are the only men to be seen in the village during the daytime--these fishermen, with their russet-brown clothing faded by the salt air into indescribably rich wallflower tones of gold and orange and red! ...

You arrive at 1866 Washington Avenue, in the Bronx, and find yourself on the steps of Tremont Library.

You approach a librarian at the reference desk. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*The Blockade of Phalsburg: An Episode of the End of the Empire*.' 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... They flew down to the very carts; but the moment a living man approached, all these creatures rose and flew away to the forest of La Bonne-Fontaine, or the ruins of the old convent of Dann. As for myself, I lengthened my steps, feeling that I must not stop, that the typhus was marching at my heels. Happily the winter sets in early at Phalsburg. A cold wind blew from the Schneeberg, and these strong draughts of mountain air disperse all maladies, even, it is said, the Black Plague itself. What I have now told you is about the retreat from Leipsic, in the beginning of November. When I reached Saverne, the city was crowded with troops, artillery, infantry, and cavalry, pell-mell. I remember that, in the principal street, the windows of an inn were open, and a long table with its white cloth was seen, all laid, within. All the guard of honor stopped there. ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You board a bus headed toward another nearby library branch.

___

This is the last library branch on your list: Red Hook Library at 7 Wolcott Street, in Brooklyn.

You approach a kindly librarian and ask him about the book you're seeking. 'I think it had a red cover,' you add hopefully.

His eyes light up. 'Ah! You must mean *The Growth of a Soul*.' He leads you to the book and plucks it from the shelf. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... John thought them mad and threw them aside. Was that the sort of stuff he was expected to read? He began to reflect over his situation. What did he expect to do in Upsala? To support himself for six years on 80 kronas till he took his degree. And then? his thoughts did not stretch further; he had no higher plan or ambition than to take his degree--the laurel crown, the graduate's coat, and then to teach the catechism in the Jakob school till his death. No, he did not wish to do that. Time went on, and Christmas approached. The little stock of money in his table-drawer diminished slowly but surely. And then? ...

'Yes!' you shout, remembering too late that you are in a library. You are holding the book you've been searching for all evening. You hurry to the circulation desk to check it out, the last patron of the night.

You rush home, looking forward to enjoying the book once more over tea.
