# If on a winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was an extraordinary book. You haven't though about it in years, though, until this afternoon, when you remembered the book in a moment of drowsiness. *That book!* What was it called? Alas! You have forgotten the title.

But you feel sure that you could recognize it by sight, or at least in reading the first few pages. And surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. You must find it; you must read it. It's only 4:00. You have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the nearest library branch.

You arrive at 25 Fourth Ave. at Pacific St., in Brooklyn, and find yourself on the steps of Pacific Library.

While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the red cloth-covered book that fell on you. '*Stories of the Foot-hills*,' you mutter. It looks familiar.

> ... A tall, unformed girl, with a braid of red hair hanging across her shoulder, and ending in a heavy, lustrous curl upon the limp folds of her blue cotton dress. The baby had resumed a subdued but dismal proclamation of the grief from which his mother's return had afforded him but a temporary relief, and Mrs. Sproul elevated her thin, anxious voice coaxingly. "Lysander's late, M'lissy, and I thought mebbe you'd milk the cow fer 'im." "Why, yes, of course," answered the girl, with a soft, good-natured drawl, descending the remaining steps slowly. "Where's the milk-pail, mother?" "On top o' the chimbly," answered the old woman tartly, pointing with the frying-pan to a bench in the corner. "If it'd 'a' been a snake, it'd 'a' bit you." The young girl crossed the room, and the satellites surrounding Mrs. Sproul's chair, with an erratic change of orbit, transferred themselves to the newcomer. ...

This doesn't sound familiar at all. Frowning, you leave the book on a reshelving cart and stride out into the evening air, ready to try another library branch. Maybe your luck will change.

She smiles politely and shelves the book she was holding. It's red and looks familiar... *Punch, or the London Charivari, Volume 100, June 20, 1891*, it's called. You take it down from the shelf.

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list, just a subway ride away.

> ... Footnote 2: Professor Ferrier, in his instructive volume, 'The Institutes of Metaphysic,' has some valuable remarks on the scope and purpose of Philosophy. I transcribe some of them, in abridgment. (Sections 1-8) "A system of philosophy is bound by two main requisitions: it ought to be true--and it ought to be reasoned. Philosophy, in its ideal perfection, is a body of reasoned truth. Of these obligations, the latter is the more stringent. It is more proper that philosophy should be reasoned, than that it should be true: because, while truth may perhaps be unattainable by man, to reason is certainly his province and within his power. . . . A system is of the highest value only when it embraces both these requisitions--that is, when it is both true, and reasoned. ...

Nick got up, shook himself, and winked at the hole in the wall where had been the electric button. He was a handsome man, as tall as Tuttle, but more slenderly built, with clean-cut features, dancing black eyes, and a black mustache that swept in an upward curve over his tanned cheek. His friend scrutinized him anxiously as he slid cartridges into the empty chambers of his revolver. "Sure you 're sober, Nick?" Ellhorn laughed. "How the devil can I tell? I can walk straight and see straight and shoot straight; and if that ain't sober enough to tackle any four-spot Greaser, I might just as well get drunk again!" "Well, I reckon you 're sober enough to jump into this job with me now; and if you stay sober, it's all right. ...

> ... Percy's _Reliques_, which was sure to be among his father's books, was entirely congenial to him, as later to little Walter Scott. Also Shakespeare and some of the Elizabethans, of whom Ben Jonson was certainly one, were absorbed into his being. Spencer's _Faery Queen_ and later poets of his own time--Rowley, Thomson, Chatterton--were his daily companions: and above all he adored with passionate idolatry the then famous _Ossian_ of Macpherson. Swinburne has expressed astonishment that the child Blake could admire such "lank and lamentable counterfeits of the poetical style" as Macpherson supplied to an undiscerning generation. We must remember that in spite of the Highland Society, then meeting in London, Blake had no easy access to the times of Fingal and Ossian, such as we have to-day. There was something in his genius which made him crave for the society of the Celtic heroes and gods. ...

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... With certain types of issue I have made no attempt to deal. I have not, for example, discussed statements such as 'Krishna was not a god but a hero of a rough tribe of cowherds.' 'The Gita is an interpolation.' 'There is general agreement on the historicity of Krishna.' 'Radha appears to be a late addition.' Higher Criticism, whether applied to the Bible or to the classics of Indian religion must necessarily remain a small scholars' preserve--of vital importance to the few but of little account to the main body of believers or to artists illustrating adored themes. I have rather been concerned to present information about Krishna in the form in which it has actually reached Indian minds and has influenced belief and worship. ...

He had heard all his life that this border line separated the sheep of his own nativity from the goats of a meaner race, and to this narrow tenet he had given unquestioning belief. "I disgusts Kaintuck'!" exclaimed the refugee half aloud as his strong hands clenched themselves, one hanging free and the other still grasping the rifle which as yet he had no intent of laying aside. "I plum disgusts Kaintuck'!" The sun was climbing now and its pallid disk was slowly flushing to the wakefulness of fiery rose. ...

This added new difficulties to what was before but too difficult in itself, the settling of a nation which no longer could put any confidence in its sovereign, nor lay more restraints on the royal authority without destroying the balance of the whole constitution. In those circumstances, the balls that pierced our hearts were directed thither by the hands of our guardian angels, to deliver us from horrors we could not support, and perhaps from a guilt our souls abhorred. _Mr. Hampden_.--Indeed, things were brought to so deplorable a state, that if either of us had seen his party triumphant, he must have lamented that triumph as the ruin of his country. ...

> ... Grain merchants and vegetable dealers jostled each other in the streets themselves. In and about among them played the boys of the city, not even half-clothed in most cases. There were no parks and playgrounds for them such as you have. Often, too, boys would be seen cantering through the streets, seated sidewise on the bare backs of ponies, caring nothing for passers-by, ponies, or each other--laughing, chatting, eating chestnuts. Other boys would be carrying on their heads small round tables covered with dishes of rice, pork, cabbage, wine, and other things. Illustration: A STREET IN SEOUL Around the city was a great wall of stone fourteen miles in length. In some places it clung to the edges of the mountains, and then dropped into a deep ravine, again to climb a still higher mountain, perhaps. In one direction it enclosed a forest, in another a barren plain. Great blocks were the stones, that had been in place many, many years. ...

He expected to be interrogated, for an attack was unlikely from a lone old woman; but he grasped his cane firmly. Luckily, a noise of steps at the other end of the street checked the hag; she thrust back out of sight what had momentarily gleamed like the steel of a knife or brass of a pistol-barrel; listened again and stared; then, muttering what was probably no prayer for the stranger's welfare, she crossed the street with amazing rapidity. ...

I had looked away. I looked again. Before me was a fat pauper, florid and over-dressed, who, in the voice of an immortal, was reading the fantasies of the damned. In his hand was a manuscript, and we were supping on "Salome." As the banquet proceeded, I experienced that sense of sacred terror which his friends, the Greeks, knew so well.

We believed that what share in the world we had and wanted was what every reasonable nation would willingly concede us, and if certain powers proved refractory and unreasonable--a most improbable contingency--we could always send forth our millions of minute men, armed with patriotism and fowling-pieces.

The sun went down as red as blood every evening behind the Palisades, and before the streets and roofs had ceased to radiate heat the sun was up again above Long Island Sound, as hot and red as ever. As Ben went uptown in the Sixth Avenue Elevated he could see pale children hanging over the railings of fire escapes, and behind them catch glimpses of dark, crowded rooms which had all the disadvantages of caves without the coolness.

"If I am mistaken," said the accuser, "I shall gladly apologize; but before I do so first let monsieur le count explain the extra cards which I saw him drop into his side pocket." And then the man whom Tarzan had seen drop them there turned to sneak from the room, but to his annoyance he found the exit barred by a tall, gray-eyed stranger. "Pardon," said the man brusquely, attempting to pass to one side. "Wait," said Tarzan. "But why, monsieur?" exclaimed the other petulantly. "Permit me to pass, monsieur." "Wait," said Tarzan. "I think that there is a matter in here that you may doubtless be able to explain." The fellow had lost his temper by this time, and with a low oath seized Tarzan to push him to one side. ...

Nat severed the tentacles at their base with the heat-beam. He turned, strode toward the door watching the spheres apprehensively out of the corner of his eye, ready to jump aside should they roll toward him suddenly. But they followed at respectful distances, singing softly. Before he reached the door, he found himself walking in rhythm to the music, his head swaying. It came slowly, insidiously; before he was aware, his body no longer obeyed his will. Muscles refused to move other than in coordination with the music. His arm relaxed, the heat-rod sliding from his grasp. * * * * But Digger! ...

Leiderman continued to scowl. "We all know each other, Pardeau. Call a spade a spade. Wyckoff was a reactionary scoundrel whom you did away with for reasons of security." "Precisely," Pardeau said. "In its essence, the formula is a process for taking over a man's brain--his body--his personality." "You mean--" Pardeau refused to be interrupted. "We were of the opinion that Wyckoff, though he and Lenster were great friends, was not able to impart his knowledge to the latter. We took him into custody shortly after he perfected the formula and were fortunate in persuading him to give it to us." "But he gave it to Lenster also? ...

> ... It is rather the general scheme on which the drama is built. It is a scheme which occurs again and again in Euripides, a study of oppression and revenge. Such a subject in the hands of a more ordinary writer would probably take the form of a triumph of oppressed virtue. But Euripides gives us nothing so sympathetic, nothing so cheap and unreal. If oppression usually made people virtuous, the problems of the world would be very different from what they are. Euripides seems at times to hate the revenge of the oppressed almost as much as the original cruelty of the oppressor; or, to put the same fact in a different light, he seems deliberately to dwell upon the twofold evil of cruelty, that it not only causes pain to the victim, but actually by means of the pain makes him a worse man, so that when his turn of triumph comes, it is no longer a triumph of justice or a thing to make men rejoice. ...

The French commander in Italy had first made peace on his own terms, and had then declared war without consulting the chambers, thus not only annihilating friendly commonwealths, but evincing a contempt for the constitution, for the duly elected representatives of the people, and for the popular demand that there should be, not a particular, but a general pacification. On June twenty-third, 1797, in a memorable interpellation of the government by Dumorlard, all these matters were thoroughly ventilated in the Five Hundred. Even Pontecoulant, Bonaparte's former protector, joined in the demand for an explanation. Paris and the country in general were left in a ferment. The disorders, murmurs, and menaces so rife in Paris had long given food for thought to the proconsul at Montebello. ...

She's only one daughter and no son, so she takes three of us young fellows to board. And I think I'm going to like it.

The two following years of his life, but for a short stay at Copenhagen, where he completed his theological studies and attained a high degree, he spent chiefly "in flogging his pupils and converting Norwegian boors." This is a humorous expression of his for the way in which he performed his duties as a tutor to the children of the vicar at Voss--now one of the best-known districts on the Bergen-Christiania Railway--and occasionally replaced him in the pulpit. By his own saying he succeeded decidedly better as a preacher than as a tutor which, by the way, does not say very much, as he never excelled in either of these functions. The chief interest connected with his stay at Voss is the fact that it strengthened his early Fron recollections of the peasants. ...

And he went his way, and travelled until he came at length to a place where three roads met; in the centre stood a column, with three inscriptions, which ran as follows: "He who turns to the right will have plenty to eat, but his steed will starve; he who goes straight forward will hunger himself, but his steed will have food enough; and whoever takes the left road will be slain by the Winged Wolf." When Lyubim Tsarevich read this, he pondered over it, and resolved to go no other road but to choose the left, and either be slain himself, or destroy the Winged Wolf, and free all those who might be travelling that way. So he journeyed on until he came to the open plains, where he pitched his tent to rest, when on a sudden he perceived in the west the Winged Wolf come flying toward him. ...

And the old hot-and-cold, happy, frightened, laughing, sobbing sensation would have me by the throat again. Well, we were married. Love cast a glamour over his very vices. His love of drink? A weakness which I would transform into strength. His white hot flashes of uncontrollable temper? Surely they would die down at my cool, tender touch. His fits of abstraction and irritability? Mere evidences of the genius within. Oh, my worshiping soul was always alert with an excuse. And so we were married. He had quite tired of me in less than a year, and the hand that had always shaken a little shook a great deal now, and the fits of abstraction and temper could be counted upon to appear oftener than any other moods. ...

Others, such as coal and iron, will last much longer, but when they are gone they can never be replaced; and so far as we can now foresee, the country will cease to prosper when they can no longer be had for use in manufacturing. The length of time they will last at the present rate of use can be easily calculated. It is a long time for us to look forward, for it is longer than the lifetime of any man now living, or of his children, but it is within the life of his grandchildren, and that is a very short time in the history of a nation. It may be said that while other nations have passed into decay, none has ever exhausted its resources so early in its history, and surely this great rich nation can not so soon face actual need. But we must remember that no other nation has ever used its resources as we have used ours. We are using in years what other nations have used in centuries. ...

As the prairie schooner drew nearer the wonder and excitement of the family increased. On the high driver's seat in the front of the wagon they could now make out a woman; a woman young, beautiful, white and livid as death; a mass of hair that gleamed like molten gold in the sunshine blowing wildly about her shoulders, her eyes distended, her arms bare to the elbows extended far in front of her, one hand clutching the reins, the other lashing the panting, staggering horses, that, lathered with foam and sweat, were heaving and stumbling, ready to drop with exhaustion. ...

Having no flying robots, Robert was compelled to transport himself and a few mechanical servants in ground vehicles. He had--idiotically, he now realized--started with the dawn, and was already tired. Consequently, he was perhaps unduly annoyed when two tiny spy-eyes flew down from the hills to hover above his caravan on whirring little propellers. He tried to glance up pleasantly while their lenses televised pictures to their base, but he feared that his smile was strained. The spy-eyes retired after a few minutes. Robert's vehicle, at his voiced order, turned onto a road leading between two forested hills. _Right there_, he thought four hours later, _was where I made my mistake. ...

This opinion of the "European Magazine" was the one most generally adopted. It was re-echoed almost invariably when Mary Wollstonecraft's name was mentioned in print. A Mrs. West, who, in 1801, published a series of "Letters to a Young Man," full of goodly discourse and moral exhortation, found occasion to warn him against Mary's works, which she did with as much energy as if the latter had been the Scarlet Woman of Babylon in the flesh. ...

One or two of the women clearly had been accustomed to a smoother life, but there was nothing to suggest that they looked back to it with regret. As a matter of fact, they looked forward, working for the future, and there was patient courage in their smiling eyes.

His countrymen of his own order had long displayed these peculiarities of humour. The small Scottish cultivators from whose ranks Knox rose, appear, even before his age, in two strangely different lights. If they were not technically "kindly tenants," in which case their conditions of existence and of tenure were comparatively comfortable and secure, they were liable to eviction at the will of the lord, and, to quote an account of their condition written in 1549, "were in more servitude than the children of Israel in Egypt. ...

But it was no longer possible to check this tendency, for, by force of circumstances, it had been planted in the very soul of every Russian who compared the conditions of life in his country with what European civilization had done for the neighboring countries. Excluded from journalism, this satiric tendency took refuge in literature, where the novel and the story trace the incidents of daily life. Since the writers could not touch the evil at its source, they showed its consequences for social life. They represented with eloquence the empty and deplorable banality of the existence forced upon most of them. By expressing in various ways general aspirations towards something better, they let literature continue its teaching, even in times particularly hostile to freedom of thought, like the reign of Nicholas I, the most typical and decided adversary of the freedom of the pen that Europe has ever seen. ...

We are on every side surrounded by water, and nowhere can we get away to any other country without crossing the sea. The very nearest country to us is France, and at the narrowest point of the Channel there are only twenty-one miles of sea to get over. One way of starting on our great enterprise is to cross this little strip of water and take the train across France, right to the other side, there to meet a ship which will carry us onward. ...

The cotton factories of the world annually require about 12,000,000 bales of cotton, American weight. Good land in Texas produces one bale to the acre. The world's supply of cotton could be grown on less than 19,000 square miles, or upon an area equal to only seven per cent. of the area of Texas. * * * * * THE COLOR-LINE QUESTION: WHAT IS IT? 1. It is not the question of _social_ equality. No one doubts the right of individuals, or the family, or the social circle, to draw their lines of association and fellowship at their own pleasure, whether at wealth, rank, fashion, talent, or anything else. To confound this with the real question, is not candid. 2. Still less is it the question of the inter-marriage of the races. Here, individual preference is undeniable. ...

In hiding, I heard her sneer at him. I heard her mock him. I would have doubted him forever if I had heard her praise him, but she did not, and I knew him to be a true man. Ours is more like the French than the British system; there is more intercourse between officer and non-commissioned officer and man. But Ranjoor Singh is a silent man, and we of his squadron, though we respected him, knew little of what was in his mind. When there began to be talk about his knowing German, and about his secrecy, and about his nights spent at HER place, who could answer? We all knew he knew German. ...

Donald tried not to become impatient while these arrangements were being made.

He had worked for the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and had spent several years in India studying snake poisons. His purchase of this humdrum suburban practice had been dictated by a desire to make a home for a girl who at the eleventh hour had declined to share it.

You walk every aisle, but nothing looks promising. Suddenly, a young woman rushes past you, and a book falls out of her bag. 'Hey!' you call after her, but she has already left. You pick up the book and read the title: *Ten Years Later*. It has a red cover and a familiar weight in your hand. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... At Belle-Isle, D'Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications is, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that's not all. The blueprints for the island, although in Porthos's handwriting, show evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis. D'Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes, which is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting that D'Artagnan has arrived on the king's behalf to investigate, Aramis tricks D'Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos, and sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of the danger. Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a present, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating Colbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an audience with the king. And now, the second etext of The Vicomte de Bragelonne. Enjoy! ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You board a bus headed toward another nearby library branch.

___

You arrive at 9 West 124th Street, in Manhattan, and find yourself on the steps of Harlem Library.

You approach a kindly librarian and ask him about the book you're seeking. 'I think it had a red cover,' you add hopefully.

His eyes light up. 'Ah! You must mean *...After a Few Words...*.' He leads you to the book and plucks it from the shelf. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... The Egyptians tried to dodge, as they saw, too late, the approach of the Christian knights. Sir Robert felt the shock against himself and his horse as the steel tip of the long ash lance struck the Saracen horseman in the chest. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that Sir Gaeton, too, had scored. The Saracen, impaled on Sir Robert's lance, shot from the saddle as he died. His lighter armor had hardly impeded the incoming spear-point, and now his body dragged it down as he dropped toward the desert sand. Another Moslem cavalryman was charging in now, swinging his curved saber, taking advantage of Sir Robert's sagging lance. There was nothing else to do but drop the lance and draw his heavy broadsword. His hand grasped it, and it came singing from its scabbard. The Egyptian's curved sword clanged against Sir Robert's helm, setting his head ringing. ...

No, this isn't the book you had in mind, although it does intrigue you. You consider checking it out, but you don't have much time before the next branch closes. You go outside and point your feet toward the next branch on your list.

___

You arrive at 40 West 20th Street, in Manhattan, and find yourself on the steps of Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library.

While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the red cloth-covered book that fell on you. '*The Napoleon of Notting Hill*,' you mutter. It looks familiar. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... And in the same way his impetuous friend, Dr. Zoppi ("the Paul of Anglo-Saxonism"), carried it yet further, and held that, as a result of this view, cannibalism should be held to mean eating a member of the Empire, not eating one of the subject peoples, who should, he said, be killed without needless pain. His horror at the idea of eating a man in British Guiana showed how they misunderstood his stoicism who thought him devoid of feeling. He was, however, in a hard position; as it was said that he had attempted the experiment, and, living in London, had to subsist entirely on Italian organ-grinders. ...

You stop reading. This isn't your book, this is some other strange text. It bothers you for some reason. You leave it on the shelf and go outside, taking calming breaths. Time to try the next library branch.

___

You arrive at 158-21 Jewel Avenue, in Flushing, and find yourself on the steps of Pomonok Library.

While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the red cloth-covered book that fell on you. '*Johnny Ludlow, Second Series*,' you mutter. It looks familiar.

> ... "No, Mr. Joe; at mine." "Well, it's an awful sell for us," grumbled Tod. "It's not so often we get a night at Worcester, that we should be done out of this chance." "The fact is, I don't feel well," said the Squire, "and should most likely have gone home, whether Prothero had come in or not. I'm afraid I have caught cold, Joe." There was not any more to be said. The Squire's colds were no joke: once he caught one, he would be downright ill; laid up for days. We went back by rail to Timberdale, and took a fly home. The next morning the Squire did not get up. Sure enough he had a cold, and was feverish. At breakfast Mrs. Todhetley said one of us should go over to South Crabb and ask Mr. Cole to call and see him. "Why, the pater hates doctors!" exclaimed Tod. "I know he does," she answered. "But I feel sure that if he would only take remedies for his colds in time, they would not be so bad as they usually are, Joseph. Who's that? ...

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list, just a subway ride away.

___

You arrive at 240 Division Avenue, in Brooklyn, and find yourself on the steps of Williamsburgh Library.

You approach a kindly librarian and ask him about the book you're seeking. 'I think it had a red cover,' you add hopefully.

His eyes light up. 'Ah! You must mean *The Hot Swamp*.' He leads you to the book and plucks it from the shelf.

> ... "Nay, I have no mind to give you a lecture," returned Bladud, "I only ask you to grant me two requests." "Granted, before mentioned, for you have ever been a reasonable creature, Bladud, and I trust you to retain your character on the present occasion." "Well, then, my first request is that you will often remember the many talks that you and I have had about the gods, and the future life, and the perplexing conditions in which we now live." "Remember them," exclaimed Dromas with animation, "my difficulty would be to forget them! The questions which you have propounded and attempted to answer--for I do not admit that you have been quite successful in the attempt--have started up and rung in my ears at all kinds of unseasonable times. ...

You stop reading. This isn't your book, this is some other strange text. It bothers you for some reason. You leave it on the shelf and go outside, taking calming breaths. Time to try the next library branch.

___

You arrive at 1385 East Gun Hill Road, in the Bronx, and find yourself on the steps of Eastchester Library.

As soon as you enter, you see a familiar-looking red book on display in an exhibit. You snatch it up and read the title: *The Poems of Emma Lazarus, Volume 1*. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... Loneliness and despair for a space, and then, like stars in the night, the new births of the spirit, the wonderful outcoming from sorrow: the mild light of patience at first; hope and faith kindled afresh in the very jaws of evil; the new meaning and worth of life beyond sorrow, beyond joy; and finally duty, the holiest word of all, that leads at last to victory and peace. The poem rounds and completes itself with the close of "the long, rich day," and the release of "The mystic winged and flickering butterfly, A human soul, that drifts at liberty, Ah! who can tell to what strange paradise, To what undreamed-of fields and lofty skies!" We have dwelt at some length upon this poem, which seems to us, in a certain sense, subjective and biographical; but upon closer analysis there is still another conclusion to arrive at. ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You board a bus headed toward another nearby library branch.

___

This is the last library branch on your list: Queens Central Library at 89-11 Merrick Boulevard, in Jamaica.

While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the red cloth-covered book that fell on you. '*The Gates Between*,' you mutter. It looks familiar. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

> ... I had often quoted him to nervous people whom I considered as exaggerating their sufferings; I did not recall the quotation at that moment. "Oh! you are hurt!" a low voice said. I was a bit fastidious in voices at that time of my life. To say that this was the sweetest I had ever heard would not express what I mean. It was the _dearest_ I had ever heard. From that first moment,--before I saw her face,--drowned as I was in that wave of mean physical agony, given over utterly to myself, I knew, and to myself I said: "It is the dearest voice in all this world." A woman on the further side of the trout-brook stood uncertain, pitifully regarding me. She was not a girl,--quite a woman; ripe, and self-possessed in bearing. ...

You smile to yourself. Yes, this book, this is the book. You walk to the checkout desk at 4:59pm, just before the library closes. On the train back to your apartment, you open to page 1. 

It's going to be a very good night.
