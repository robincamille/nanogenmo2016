# If on an winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was a wonderful book: transporting, enlightening, beautiful. Just this afternoon, you remembered this book in a moment of drowsiness. That book! What was it called? You have forgotten the title. What a pity. 

But surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. It's only 4:00; you have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the first library branch on your list.
You arrive at 191-05 Linden Boulevard, St Albans, NY 11412 and find yourself on the steps of St. Albans Library.

 As soon as you enter, you see a familiar-looking book on display in an exhibit. You snatch it up and read the title: *Mr. Meeson's Will*.

> ... "Why, what's up? "    Just then, however, he caught sight of the very handsome young lady who  was seated in the office, and his whole demeanour underwent a most  remarkable change; out came the hands from his pockets, off went the hat,  and, turning, he bowed, really rather nicely, considering how impromptu  the whole performance was. "What is it, Eustace? " asked Mr. Meeson, sharply. "Oh, nothing, uncle; nothing--it can bide," and, without waiting for an  invitation, he took a chair, and sat down in such a position that he  could see Miss Smithers without being seen of his uncle. "I was saying, Miss Smithers, or rather, I was going to say," went on the  elder Meeson, "that, in short, I do not in the least understand what you  can mean. You will remember that you were paid a sum of fifty pounds for  the copyright of 'Jemima's Vow. '"    "Great Heavens! " murmured Master Eustace, behind; "what a do! ...

You close the book, disappointed. This isn't the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library. You set off for the next branch on your list.

You arrive at 1866 Washington Avenue, Bronx, NY and find yourself on the steps of Tremont Library.

 You approach a librarian who is wearing smart tortoiseshell glasses. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*Eunice*.'

> ... The solemn-looking station-master  had wrought the change. "Well, Fidelia, you've got home, haven't you? Folks don't expect you,  do they? "    "I didn't write that I was coming. I was not sure till the last minute. Are they all well about here? "    "Yes, I guess so. Eunice is well, any way. She was to meeting Sunday;  and seems to me Lucinda said she was at the sewing-circle at the  doctor's the other day. She'll be glad to see _you_, sick or well. "    "I'm glad and thankful that she is well," said Fidelia softly. "I must  say good-bye to the girls. "    She turned quickly towards the faces at the windows. "Have you heard good news, Fidelia? " called some one. There was no time for words, but the joy on the girl's upturned face was  better than any last words could have been, even though her lips  trembled and her eyes were dim with tears. ...

 You walk every aisle, but nothing looks promising. Suddenly, a young man rushes past you, and a book falls out of his bag. 'Hey!' you call after him, but he has already left. You pick up the book and read the title: *The American Republic: Its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny*. It has a red cover and a familiar weight in your hand.

> ... The error of the Government is not in recognizing the  territorial laws as surviving secession but in counting a State that  has seceded as still a State in the Union, with the right to be counted  as one of the United States in amending the Constitution. Such State  goes out of the Union, but comes under it. I have endeavored throughout to refer my particular political views; to  their general principles, and to show that the general principles  asserted have their origin and ground in the great, universal, and  unchanging principles of the universe itself. Hence, I have labored to  show the scientific relations of political to theological principles,  the real principles of all science, as of all reality. An atheist, I  have said, may be a politician; but if there were no God, there could  be no politics. ...

> ... Now, you must know right here, that Christmas in these South American  countries is not the greatest festival of the entire year, as it is with  us; it is simply one of the many that are celebrated at frequent  intervals, for Argentina is a land of _fiestas_; there is scarcely a  month that does not allow three or four holidays from school because of  some _fiesta_, either of church or state. Although they do not celebrate  this great holiday as we do with Christmas trees and visits from Santa  Claus, they have something in their places, and it is the "Coming of  the Three Kings. " In anticipation of this, all over the Republic,  children erect _pesebres_ or mangers. A _pesebre_ consists of a miniature open shed, or merely a roof of straw  or bark, underneath which, in a tiny box, lies a porcelain baby doll to  represent the infant Christ. ...

You arrive at 93 Saint Edwards Street, Brooklyn, NY and find yourself on the steps of Walt Whitman Library.

 While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the book that fell on you. '*The Battle of Blenheim*,' you mutter. Perhaps this was a sign. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... The plan was  indeed Eugene's; and in the battle itself he shared the glory with his  English friend and colleague. Again, the British troops present were few  indeed compared with the total of the allied forces. At Blenheim, in  particular, they amounted to less than a third of the numbers present. The  excellence of their material, however, their magnificent work at the  Schellenberg and on Blenheim field itself, coupled with the fact that the  general to whom the final success is chiefly due was the great military  genius of this country, warrants the historian in classing this battle  among British actions, and in treating its story as a national affair. ...

Aunt Kate gives me a can of cat food and a box of litter, so Cat can stay  in my room, because I remember Mom probably gets asthma from animals, too. Cat and I go home. Pop does a lot of shouting and sputtering when we get home, but I just put  Cat down in my room, and I try not to argue with him, so I won't lose my  temper. I promise I'll keep him in my room and sweep up the cat hairs so  Mom won't have to. As a final blast Pop says, "I suppose you'll get your exercise mouse  hunting now. What are you going to name the noble animal? "    "Look, Pop," I explain, "I know he's a cat, he knows he's a cat, and his  name is Cat.
