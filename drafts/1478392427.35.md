# If on an winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was a wonderful book: transporting, enlightening, beautiful. Just this afternoon, you remembered this book in a moment of drowsiness. That book! What was it called? You have forgotten the title. What a pity. 

But surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. It's only 4:00; you have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the first library branch on your list.

You arrive at 610 East 186th Street, Bronx, NY and find yourself on the steps of Belmont Library and Enrico Fermi Cultural Center.

 As soon as you enter, you see a familiar-looking book on display in an exhibit. You snatch it up and read the title: *Robert Hardy's Seven Days: A Dream and Its Consequences*.

> ... The men flatly refused to work another minute, and went  out in a body. I don't blame them much. Robert, don't you believe God  will punish you for keeping the shops open on Sunday? "    "Nonsense, Mary," replied Mr. Hardy; yet there was a shadow of  uneasiness in his tone. "The work has got to go on. It is a work of  necessity. Railroads are public servants; they can't rest Sundays. "    "Then when God tells the world that it must not work on Sundays, He  does not mean railroad men? The Fourth Commandment ought to read,  'Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy, except all ye men who work  for railroads. Ye haven't any Sunday. '"    "Mary, I didn't come from one sermon to listen to another. You're  worse than Mr. Jones. "    Mr. Hardy half rose on the lounge and leaned on his elbow, looking at  his wife with every mark of displeasure on his face. ...

No, this isn't the book you had in mind, although it does intrigue you. You consider checking it out, but you don't have much time before the next branch closes. You go outside and point your feet toward the next branch on your list.

I'm always saying to the Town  Council, 'You must give 'em clink,' I says, 'that gang of Bolshevists,  for the slightest infractionment of the laws against drunkenness. '  Yes, indeed! There's that Jean Latrouille in the Town Council, eh? They talk about keeping order, but as soon as it's a question of  a-doing of it, they seem like a cold draught. "    The good fellow is angry. He raises his great fist and shakes it in  space like a medieval mace. Pointing where Brisbille has just plunged  floundering into the night, he says, "That's what Socialists are,--the  conquering people what can't stand up on their legs!

Then I  remembered seeing a sign that said "Free Parking" somewhere, not too  far away, and went back the way I'd come. There was a sort of park, with a fountain spraying water all over the  grass, and a big building opposite, and the white lines here were much  more sensible. They were painted in diagonal strips, so you could get  in and out quite easily, without all that backing and twisting and  turning. I left the car there, and remembered to take the keys with  me, and started walking back to the drugstore. *       *       *       *       *    That was when it hit me. ...

" He milked the  big, red, barrel-bodied cow, and churned industriously for butter; he  kept the little vegetable garden in order and nursed the Savoys into  fatness like plumping babies; he drove the goats to pasture on the  mountain slopes, and all day sat among the rhododendrons, the forgotten  soul behind his eyes conning the dead language of fate, as a foreigner  vainly interrogates the abstruse complexity of an idiom. By-and-by I made it an irregular habit to accompany him on these  shepherdings; to join him in his simple midday meal of sour brown bread  and goat-milk cheese; to talk with him desultorily, and study him the  while, inasmuch as he wakened an interest in me that was full of  speculation.

The circumstance requires explanation, and it shall be briefly given. The man was Ben Brace,--the bravest and best sailor on board the  slave-bark, and one who would not have shipped in such a craft but for  wrongs he had suffered while in the service of his country, and that had  inducted him into a sort of reckless disposition, of which, however, he  had long since repented. The boy had also been the victim of a similar disposition. Longing to  see foreign lands, he had _run away to sea_; and by an unlucky accident,  through sheer ignorance of her character, had chosen the _Pandora_ in  which to make his initiatory voyage. From the cruel treatment he had  been subjected to on board the bark, he had reason to see his folly. ...

"I did what had to be done, nothing more. "    "But I will remember it," she calmly repeated. Parker was silent. Under her hardness for the first time he glimpsed  something deeper, finer. She was the type who meant what she said. She  was a woman who paid her debts. Under other circumstances.... Parker put  the thought out of his mind. Now he set about doing what had to be done--paddling to the island. He  turned his eyes toward it. The island was gone. Calm, serene, the level face of the sea stretched  away to the horizon.

The most obvious example of a mediaeval animistic belief is that in  "elementals"--the spirits which personify the primordial forces of  Nature, and are symbolised by the four elements, immanent in which they  were supposed to exist, and through which they were held to manifest  their powers. And astrology, it must be remembered, is essentially a  systematised animism. The stars, to the ancients, were not material  bodies like the earth, but spiritual beings. PLATO (427-347 B.C. ) speaks  of them as "gods". Mediaeval thought did not regard them in quite this  way. But for those who believed in astrology, and few, I think, did  not, the stars were still symbols of spiritual forces operative on man.

Captain of the rowing club, he had not time or opportunity  to devote himself, as he would have liked, to cricket, and was not  therefore in the eleven. But he was in the twenty-two. He was also a  distinguished member of the football team, and a good athlete. At the  last sports he had won the mile in the record time for his school of  four minutes forty-nine seconds, and had, in addition, carried off the  half-mile, the quarter-mile, and the grand steeplechase. Winning as  well the long jump and throwing the cricket ball, he was easily _victor  ludorum_ in the school sports. Although not a brilliantly clever boy, he was possessed of quite average  brains. ...
