# If on an winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was a wonderful book: transporting, enlightening, beautiful. Just this afternoon, you remembered this book in a moment of drowsiness. That book! What was it called? You have forgotten the title. What a pity. 

But surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. It's only 4:00; you have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the first library branch on your list.


You arrive at 947 Castle Hill Avenue, Bronx, NY and find yourself on the steps of Castle Hill Library.

 As you walk through the stacks, you bump into a tall woman. 'Excuse me,' you murmur. 'I was just looking for a book.'

She smiles politely and shelves the book she was holding. It looks familiar... *Dotty Dimple's Flyaway*, it's called. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...

I bundled it all       up in my dress, 'cause I didn't want the cat to get it. When       I went home I gave it to the cat. [You got that _wroten_? ]         "There wasn't any _dead_ little kittens. She gave me a       cookie, and I eated it, and I told her to give me another to       bring home, 'cause I liked her cookies; they was curly       cookies. [Got it wroted, mamma? ]         "Now 'bout I pumped full a pail full o' water. "[She _knows_ we've got a house? ]         "Now say good by, and I kiss her a pretty little kiss. O,       no; I want her to come and see me,--her and Prudy,--_two_       of 'em! I's here yet. ['Haps she knows it! ]         "That's all--I feel sleepy. (Signed) "From         "DOTTY DIMPWILL TO FLYWER. ...

No, this isn't the book you had in mind, although it does intrigue you. You consider checking it out, but you don't have much time before the next branch closes. You go outside and point your feet toward the next branch on your list.

You arrive at 1305 Cortelyou Road, Brooklyn, NY and find yourself on the steps of Cortelyou Library.

 While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the book that fell on you. '*Artistic Anatomy of Animals*,' you mutter. Perhaps this was a sign. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... PAGE        1.

You stop reading. This isn't your book, this is some other strange text. You leave it on the shelf and go outside. Time to try the next library branch.

You arrive at 617 DeKalb Avenue, Brooklyn, NY and find yourself on the steps of Marcy Library.

 While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the book that fell on you. '*Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar*,' you mutter. Perhaps this was a sign. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... With the aid of  a European, however, the thing might be easily accomplished. He  sounded Werper. "You have heard of the man men call Tarzan? " he asked. Werper nodded. "I have heard of him; but I do not know him. "    "But for him we might carry on our 'trading' in safety and with great  profit," continued the Arab. "For years he has fought us, driving us  from the richest part of the country, harassing us, and arming the  natives that they may repel us when we come to 'trade. ' He is very  rich. If we could find some way to make him pay us many pieces of gold  we should not only be avenged upon him; but repaid for much that he has  prevented us from winning from the natives under his protection. "    Werper withdrew a cigaret from a jeweled case and lighted it. "And you have a plan to make him pay? " he asked. ...

This doesn't sound familiar at all. Frowning, you leave the book on a reshelving cart and stride out into the evening air, ready to try another library branch.

You arrive at Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, New York, NY and find yourself on the steps of Stephen A. Schwarzman Building.

 As soon as you enter, you see a familiar-looking book on display in an exhibit. You snatch it up and read the title: *Every Man out of His Humour*. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... "Every Man in His Humour," probably first acted late in the summer  of 1598 and at the Curtain, is commonly regarded as an epoch-making  play; and this view is not unjustified. As to plot, it tells  little more than how an intercepted letter enabled a father to  follow his supposedly studious son to London, and there observe his  life with the gallants of the time. The real quality of this  comedy is in its personages and in the theory upon which they are  conceived. Ben Jonson had theories about poetry and the drama, and  he was neither chary in talking of them nor in experimenting with  them in his plays. ...

You stop reading. This isn't your book, this is some other strange text. You leave it on the shelf and go outside. Time to try the next library branch.

You arrive at 518 West 125th Street, New York, NY and find yourself on the steps of George Bruce Library.

 You browse the shelves and find yourself attracted to a book entitled *Stories of the Lifeboat*. Is this the one you've been looking for? 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... Sir William Hillary, himself a lifeboat hero, published a striking  appeal to the nation on behalf of the perishing mariner, and as the  result of his exertions the Royal National Institution for the  Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was established in 1824. This  Society still exists under the well-known name of the Royal National  Lifeboat Institution. It commenced its splendid career with about  L10,000, and in its first year built and stationed a dozen lifeboats on  different parts of the coast. For many years the Society did good work, though sadly crippled for want  of funds. In 1850 the Duke of Northumberland offered the sum of one  hundred guineas for the best model of a lifeboat. Not only from all  parts of Great Britain, but also from America, France, Holland, and  Germany, plans and models were sent in to the number of two hundred and  eighty. ...

You arrive at 222 East 79th Street, New York, NY and find yourself on the steps of Yorkville Library.

 You approach a librarian who is wearing smart tortoiseshell glasses. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*The Great English Short-Story Writers, Volume 1*.' 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... Of these the tales of Aesop are the best examples. The  beast-fable has never quite gone out of fashion, and never will so  long as men retain their world-wonder, and childishness of mind. A large part of Gulliver's adventures belong to this class of  literature. It was only the other day that Mr. Kipling gave us his  _Just-so Stories_, and his _Jungle-Book_, each of which found an  immediate and secure place in the popular memory. Mr. Chandler Harris, in his introduction to _Uncle Remus_, warns us  that however humorous his book may appear, "its intention is perfectly  serious. " He goes on to insist on its historic value, as a revelation  of primitive modes of thought. ...

No, this isn't the book you had in mind, although it does intrigue you. You consider checking it out, but you don't have much time before the next branch closes. You go outside and point your feet toward the next branch on your list.

> ... 1918            From far away the lost adventures gleam,    The print of childhood's feet that dance and run,    The love of her who showed me to the sun    In triumph of creation, who did seem    With vivid spirit like a rainbow stream    To paint the shells, young blossoms, one by one    Each strange and delicate toy, whose hands have spun    The woven cloth of wonder like a dream ... The row of soldiered books, authority    Sharp as the scales I strummed upon the keys,    The priest who damned the things I dared not praise,    Rebellion, love made sad with mystery--    And like a firefly through the twilit trees    Romance, the golden play-boy of my days. ...

No, this can't be it. You shelve the book and leave quickly. It's getting dark outside, and there isn't much time left. You head to the next nearest library branch.

You arrive at 444 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY and find yourself on the steps of St. Agnes Library.

 You walk every aisle, but nothing looks promising. Suddenly, a young man rushes past you, and a book falls out of his bag. 'Hey!' you call after him, but he has already left. You pick up the book and read the title: *In the Roar of the Sea*. It has a red cover and a familiar weight in your hand. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... Do you hear the roar  of the sea, papa? " she repeated. "Yes, Ju. There will be a storm shortly. The sea is thrown into great  swells of rollers, a sure token that something is coming. Before night  a gale will be on us. "    Then ensued silence. Judith with one finger trifled with the  guelder-rose bunch in her lap musingly, not desirous to resume her  play with it. Something in her father's manner was unusual, and made  her uneasy. "My dear! " he began, after a pause, "one must look out to sea--into  the vast mysterious sea of the future--and prepare for what is coming  from it. Just now the air is still, and we sit in this sweet, sunny  garden, and lean our backs against the warm wall, and smell the  fragrance of the flowers; but we hear the beating of the sea, and know  that a mighty tempest, with clouds and darkness, is coming. So in  other matters we must look out and be ready--count the time till it  comes. ...

You stop reading. This isn't your book, this is some other strange text. You leave it on the shelf and go outside. Time to try the next library branch.

You arrive at 455 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY and find yourself on the steps of Mid-Manhattan Library.

 You approach a kindly librarian and ask him about a the book you're seeking. 'I think it had a red cover,' you add.

His eyes light up. 'Ah! You must mean *The People's Idea of God: Its Effect On Health And Christianity*.' He leads you to the book and plucks it from the shelf. 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... Periods and peoples are characterized by their highest or their  lowest ideals, by their God and their devil. We are all sculptors,  working out our own ideals, and leaving the impress of mind on the  body as well as on history and marble, chiselling to higher  excellence, or leaving to rot and ruin the mind's ideals. Recognizing  this as we ought, we shall turn often from marble to model, from  matter to Mind, to beautify and exalt our lives. "Chisel in hand stood a sculptor-boy,        With his marble block before him;      And his face lit up with a smile of joy        As an angel dream passed o'er him. He carved the dream on that shapeless stone        With many a sharp incision. ...

This is not the book. You snap it shut, beginning to feel despondent. But it might be in a different library. You leave in a hurry for the next branch on your list.
