# If on an winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was a wonderful book: transporting, enlightening, beautiful. Just this afternoon, you remembered this book in a moment of drowsiness. That book! What was it called? You have forgotten the title. What a pity. 

But surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. It's only 4:00; you have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the first library branch on your list.

 You browse the shelves and find yourself attracted to a book entitled *Poems*. Is this the one you've been looking for? 

You flip to a random page and begin to read...
> ... Most  modern poets who are antique are rather over-Hellenic, in their wish not  to be English or French, but there is nothing voluntary in Mr. Cawein's  naturalization in the older world of myth and fable; he is too sincerely  and solely a poet to be a _posseur;_ he has his eyes everywhere except on  the spectator, and his affair is to report the beauty that he sees, as if  there were no one by to hear. An interesting and charming trait of his poetry is its constant theme of  youth and its limit within the range that the emotions and aspirations of  youth take. ...

This doesn't sound familiar at all. Frowning, you leave the book on a reshelving cart and stride out into the evening air, ready to try another library branch.

I wouldn't have asked  for you; and General Carlson wouldn't have kept you. So there's nothing  to feel bad about. If you can't do this work, no one can. Self-recrimination is foolish when you've been put on an impossible  problem. I didn't call you in to bawl you out, but to ask you if we  should continue spending project funds for nothing. "    Jaimie raised his eyebrows at this speech, but said nothing. "What do you mean, impossible problem? " one of the interviewers  objected.

"Come down to my room," he said, "and try a pipe. I can  show you some sketches of this Blackapit. If you'd care? "    The other rose obediently and followed him down the steep. Several times Isbister heard him stumble as they came down, and his  movements were slow and hesitating. "Come in with me," said Isbister,  "and try some cigarettes and the blessed gift of alcohol.

It was completed if _touched_ by any eligible player before it  touched the ground. Any illegal pass went to the opponents at the spot  from which the pass was made. A forward pass over the goal line became a  touch back. Naturally a period of intensive experimentation followed. In 1907 the  loss of the ball on first and second down was changed to a loss of  fifteen yards. (Football Guide for 1907, pp. 137 and 168. ) In 1908 the  recovery of the touched ball was restricted to the eligible man who had  first touched it on penalty of going to the opponents at the spot. ...

The result had been the  withdrawal of the lovers, and possibly the good-will of the parents. The  return of the young lady was consequently a matter of some significance.

She gave a subdued squeal of joy, but the boy's face  was calm as a star. Minnows like that were all right for a girl to  catch and even for him to eat, but he was after game for a man. A  moment later he heard another jerk and another fish was flopping on the  bank, and this time she made no sound, but only flashed her triumphant  eyes upon him. At the third fish, she turned her eyes for approval--and  got none; and at the fourth, she did not look up at all, for he was  walking toward her.

In consequence, when we passed Finisterre, Spain, which from New  York seems almost a foreign country, was a near neighbor, a dear  friend. And the Island of Teneriffe was an anticlimax. It was as  though by a trick of the compass we had been sailing southwest and  were entering the friendly harbor of Ponce or Havana. Santa Cruz, the port town of Teneriffe, like La Guayra, rises at the  base of great hills. It is a smiling, bright-colored, red-roofed,  typical Spanish town. ...

This conception brings life into  line with other catalytic actions, and shows us a living being as a store  of potential energy, to be set free by an external stimulus which may also  excite sensation. In a subsequent chapter I have dealt with the rise of Synthetic Biology,  whose history and methods I have described.

The concern of this book, however,  is not purely with murder by women, though murder will bulk largely. Swindling will be dealt with, and casual allusion made to other crimes. But take for the moment the women accused or convicted of poisoning. What an array they make! What monsters of iniquity many of them  appear! ...

Miles of fragrant ceanothus and  manzanita bushes bloom beneath them, and lily gardens and meadows, and  damp, ferny glens in endless variety of fragrance and color, compelling  the admiration of every observer. Sweeping on over ridge and valley,  these noble trees extend a continuous belt from end to end of the range,  only slightly interrupted by sheer-walled canons at intervals of about  fifteen and twenty miles. Here the great burly brown bears delight to  roam, harmonizing with the brown boles of the trees beneath which they  feed. ...

From what one knows of him later this  is a characteristic story. One day he dismounted to look over a  gate at a view which impressed him (not very boyish this), and when  he recovered from a brown study there was no Beppo to be seen. He  walked the seven miles home, but what was characteristic was that  he called at police-stations on the way to give practical details  of his loss and a description of the pony. Few children would have  thought of this, but Scott was naturally a strange mixture of the  dreamy and the practical, and never more practical than immediately  after he had been dreamy.

Yet there are politicians in England so grossly ignorant of the German  reading of the Napoleonic lessons that they expect that Nation to  sacrifice the enormous advantage they have prepared by a whole century  of self-sacrifice and practical patriotism by an appeal to a Court of  Arbitration, and the further delays which must arise by going through  the medieaeval formalities of recalling Ambassadors and exchanging  ultimatums. Most of our present-day politicians have made their money in business--a  "form of human competition greatly resembling War," to paraphrase  Clausewitz.

Just as surely as the  circulation of bad money in a country drives out all the good, so surely  does a base and counterfeit currency in art drive out all finer and higher  things that contend with it. In his measurement of those two ancient  enemies, Tennyson and Lytton, M. Filon has shown a rare power of  understanding us and of entering into the spirit of our nineteenth-century  poetic drama. If I may be allowed a word of partial dissent from M. Filon, I would say  that he assigns too much space and influence to Robertson. Robertson did  one great thing: he drew the great and vital tragi-comic figure of Eccles. He drew many other pleasing characters and scenes, most of them as  essentially false as the falsities and theatricalities he supposed himself  to be superseding. I shall be reminded that in the volume before us M.  Filon says that all reforms of the drama pretend to be a return to nature  and to truth. ...

Strangely enough--and it is passing strange--the most  heroic personality in Homer's Iliad, the Greek's "Bible of heroisms,"  was not the Atridae, whether Agamemnon or Menelaus; not Ajax nor  Achilles, nor yet Ulysses; but was Hector, the Trojan, who appears to  greater advantage as hero than all the Grecian host. And Homer was a  Greek! This is strange and unaccountable irony. Say once more, the  old hero's lack was conscience. He, like his gods and goddesses, who  were deified infamies, was a studied impurity. Jean Valjean is a hero,  but a hero of a new type. Literature is a sure index of a civilization.

My thanks are due in a like manner  to Prof. _du Bois-Reymond_, in Berlin, who, at a later period,  also gave me his friendly help in my studies. In 1861 I published a part of my investigations in Germany,  where they found acknowledgment and favor. That little work is  contained in the following pages, together with some account of  the discoveries of Professor _Helmholtz_ relating to the human  voice, and of their practical application to the education of  the voice in singing. The practical sense of the American people enables them, above  all others, to appreciate the worth of every discovery and of  every advance. ...

> ... But a school, on account  of its numbers, must insist on the semi-mechanical virtues of  regularity, punctuality, silence, and industry. Although these are  semi-mechanical in their nature, for with much practice they become  unconscious habits, yet they furnish the very ground-work of all  combinations of man with his fellow-men. They are fundamental conditions  of social life. The increase of city population, consequent on the  growth of productive industry and the substitution of machines for hand  labor, renders necessary the universal prevalence of these cardinal  virtues of the school. Even the management of machines requires that sort of alertness which  comes from regularity and punctuality. The travel on the railroad, the  management of steam-engines, the necessities of concerted action,  require punctuality and rhythmic action. The school habit of silence means considerate regard for the rights of  fellow-workmen. ...

The great heart of Nature itself beats with a  regular systole and diastole. But, rhythmically, the modern versifier  has been a Cubist without quite comprehending it. He has been viewing  the world mathematically. He has been crowding his soul into a  geometrically designed mould. He has bowed to a rule-of-thumb order of  speech, arbitrarily imposed on him by an ancestry which wrung its  ingenuous pleasure out of an ingenuous regularity of stress and accent. To succeed under that law he must practise an adroit form of  self-deception, solemnly pretending to fit his lines to a mould which  he actually over-runs and occasionally ignores. ...

There is plenty of  connection between life and poetry, but it is, so to say, a connection  underground. The two may be called different forms of the same thing:  one of them having (in the usual sense) reality, but seldom fully  satisfying imagination; while the other offers something which satisfies  imagination but has not full 'reality. ' They are parallel developments  which nowhere meet, or, if I may use loosely a word which will be  serviceable later, they are analogues.

> ... As this  end is achieved the necessity for the strict definition given above  disappears and the "community" becomes _that aggregation of people the  majority of whose local interests have a common center_. This is the  sense in which the term will be used in this discussion. The term "rural" likewise conveys a different thought to different  people. Indeed, so likely has the term been to mislead that in a  recent national survey of religious conditions, the term was abandoned  and "town and country" substituted. The simpler plan is to arrive at a  definition of the word "rural" which will include what the latter  term connotes. To confuse "rural" with "agricultural" is to ignore  both the past and the present in movements of population and in  organization of interests. ...

Thus  the boy is father of the man in a new sense, in that his qualities are  indefinitely older and existed, well compacted, untold ages before the  more distinctly human attributes were developed. Indeed there are a  few faint indications of an earlier age node, at about the age of six,  as if amid the instabilities of health we could detect signs that this  may have been the age of puberty in remote ages of the past. ...

Generous fishermen cannot fail to look with pity upon the benighted  persons who have no better conception than this of the uses and  beneficent objects of rational diversion. In these sad and ominous days  of mad fortune-chasing, every patriotic, thoughtful citizen, whether he  fishes or not, should lament that we have not among our countrymen more  fishermen. There can be no doubt that the promise of industrial peace,  of contented labor and of healthful moderation in the pursuit of  wealth, in this democratic country of ours, would be infinitely improved  if a large share of the time which has been devoted to the concoction of  trust and business combinations, had been spent in fishing. ...
