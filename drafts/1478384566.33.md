# If on an winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was a wonderful book: transporting, enlightening, beautiful. Just this afternoon, you remembered this book in a moment of drowsiness. That book! What was it called? You have forgotten the title. What a pity. 

But surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. It's only 4:00; you have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the first library branch on your list.
You arrive at 328 East 67th Street, New York, NY and find yourself on the steps of 67th Street Library.
 You browse the shelves and find yourself attracted to a book entitled *Punch, or the London Charivari, Volume 107, November 3, 1894*. Is this the one you've been looking for?

> ... I.--THE OLD WAY. SCENE.--_A Chamber in a Civic Building. The Town Clerk and the Auditor discovered at a table covered with papers._  _Clerk._ Then I believe that you are entirely satisfied with the accounts? _Auditor._ Oh, perfectly. (_After a pause._) There is one item I wanted to ask about--I've no doubt you'll be able to explain it satisfactorily--it's this "L25 for ginger-beer to the Mayor and Council on the occasion of opening the new Cemetery. " Does not--er--that sum represent a rather large number of bottles? _Clerk_ (_in an off-hand way_). Well, we put down ginger-beer, you know, as it _looks_ better, and there's a rather strong temperance party in the borough. Of course, it was really champagne--"extra sec," too, you bet! _Auditor._ Oh, of course. I merely mentioned the matter for the sake of form. And the "L15 for cigars"--that was an expenditure incurred at the same time, I conclude? _Clerk_ (_carelessly_). Oh, yes. ...
You close the book, disappointed. This isn't the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library. You set off for the next branch on your list.

You arrive at 446 Third Avenue, New York, NY and find yourself on the steps of Kips Bay Library.
 You approach a librarian who is wearing smart tortoiseshell glasses. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*Chickamauga. Useless, Disastrous Battle*.'

> ... I read in an English magazine that an Englishman on one of Dewey's ships in Manilla Bay noticed that the gunner's lips moved as if he was saying something after each shot. He crowded up close to him, and every time the gun was fired the gunner said "Cash. " The Englishman told the captain of the ship about it, who said the explanation was easy--that gunner before he enlisted in the navy was a dry-goods clerk, and always said "Cash" when a transaction was completed. The soldiers who saved the Republic were citizen soldiers, the best soldiery in the world, and it will always be so while the Republic shall endure. ...

 While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the book that fell on you. '*The Firing Line*,' you mutter. Perhaps this was a sign.

> ... This cool unconsciousness of self, of him, of a situation which to any wholesome masculine mind contained the germs of humour, romance, and all sorts of amusing possibilities, began to be a little irksome to him. And still her aloofness amused him, too. "Do you know of any decorous reason why we should not talk to each other occasionally during this fog? " he asked. She turned her head, considered him inattentively, then turned it away again. "No," she said indifferently; "what did you desire to say? "  Resting on his oars, the unrequited smile still forlornly edging his lips, he looked at his visitor, who was staring into the fog, lost in her own reflections; and never a glimmer in her eyes, never a quiver of lid or lash betrayed any consciousness of his gaze or even of his presence. And he continued to inspect her with increasing annoyance. ...

> ... Not until the riders drew rein at "The Hall" did Henry Mogridge overtake his cousin in the headlong race home. As it was, she dismounted before he could offer assistance and ran up the steps and across the white pillared veranda into the great wainscoted hall. An instant she paused, looking up at the portrait of a beautiful woman hanging there, and then went to her room. The flickering light from the logs in the big fireplace relieved the shadows on the face in the frame, a face so like that of the girl's as to leave no doubt whence she had inherited her charms. The colour of hair and eyes, the poise of head, all were strikingly like, but in the girl's face was a wilful recklessness, perhaps due to lack of a mother's care, the mother she had never known, but more than probable an inheritance from her father, the reckless, hot-headed, sporting squire. At table that evening the girl said little and made an excuse to leave before the last course. ...

'The land,' said the ten spies, 'is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; the cities are walled up to heaven, and very great, and the children of Anak dwell in them.

 You walk every aisle, but nothing looks promising. Suddenly, a young man rushes past you, and a book falls out of his bag. 'Hey!' you call after him, but he has already left.

> ... Popular opinion at that time was in favour of the mechanical rather than the chemical explanation of agricultural facts, and Tull's work had the effect of confirming this opinion, and turning attention away from the application of chemistry to agriculture. Indeed, no good results could have followed its study at that time, for chemistry, especially in those departments bearing more immediately on agriculture, was much too imperfect, and it was only towards the close of the last century, when Lavoisier established its true principles, that it became possible to pursue it with any prospect of success. ...
