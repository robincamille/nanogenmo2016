# If on an winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was a wonderful book: transporting, enlightening, beautiful. Just this afternoon, you remembered this book in a moment of drowsiness. That book! What was it called? You have forgotten the title. What a pity. 

But surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. It's only 4:00; you have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the first library branch on your list.

You arrive at 150 West 100th Street, New York, NY and find yourself on the steps of Bloomingdale Library.

 While browsing the stacks, something heavy suddenly falls onto your head. 'Ouch!' you shout. But no one is nearby. You rub your cranium and look at the book that fell on you. '*Smoke*,' you mutter. Perhaps this was a sign.

> ... It is in fact difficult to find  among the great modern artists men whose natural balance of intellect  can be said to equalise their special genius. The Greeks alone present  to the world a spectacle of a triumphant harmony in the critical and  creative mind of man, and this is their great pre-eminence. But _Smoke_  presents the curious feature of a novel (Slav in virtue of its modern  psychological genius) which is classical in its treatment and expression  throughout: the balance of Turgenev's intellect reigns ever supreme over  the natural morbidity of his subject. And thus _Smoke_ in every sense of the word is a classic for all time. EDWARD GARNETT. ...You close the book, disappointed. This isn't the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library. You set off for the next branch on your list.

> ... Matters were growing worse in the Ohio valley. The Virginians had  erected forts at what is now Pittsburg; and the French, about fifteen  miles south of Lake Erie. Governor Dinwiddie determined to make a last  remonstrance with the French who should thus presume to come upon  English territory. The way to their forts lay through an unsettled  wilderness, a distance of from five hundred to six hundred miles. Some  Indian tribes favored one nation; some the other. The governor offered  this dangerous commission--a visit to the French--to several persons,  who hastened to decline with thanks the proffered honor. Young Washington, with his brave heart, was willing to undertake the  journey, and started September 30, 1753, with horses, tents, and other  necessary equipments. They found the rivers swollen, so that the horses  had to swim. The swamps, in the snow and rain, were almost impassable. At last they arrived at the forts, early in December. ...You close the book, disappointed. This isn't the book you were thinking of. It must be in a different library.

> ... Most  modern poets who are antique are rather over-Hellenic, in their wish not  to be English or French, but there is nothing voluntary in Mr. Cawein's  naturalization in the older world of myth and fable; he is too sincerely  and solely a poet to be a _posseur;_ he has his eyes everywhere except on  the spectator, and his affair is to report the beauty that he sees, as if  there were no one by to hear. An interesting and charming trait of his poetry is its constant theme of  youth and its limit within the range that the emotions and aspirations of  youth take. ...

Soon  they heard nothing more than the sound of dripping blood as it fell from  the brow of Balthasar on the breast of Balkis. "I love you," the queen murmured. And by the light of the moon as it emerged from behind a cloud the  king saw the white and liquid radiance of her half-closed eyes. They  descended the dry bed of a stream, and suddenly Balthasar's foot slipped  on the moss and they fell together locked in each other's embrace. They seemed to sink forever into a delicious void, and the world of  the living ceased to exist for them. ...

The rendering of a beautiful  passage of colour, of a gracious form, or a delicate play of light and  shade, was never held to be sufficient. Within the body of phenomena he  saw the throbbing heart and luminous soul of Nature revealed; and it was  the very heart and soul of his subject that he strove to prison in his  pigments. At the same time, dreamer as he was, there was always in him a  healthiness and sanity rare indeed amongst those who are given to seeing  visions. I remember a studio gathering at which Corot was discussed. I wish the  master, who always loved to be praised by those who could understand and  were sincere, could have heard what was said of him.

He had had a couple of bottles of wine, but it was  not the wine alone that was having this effect on Olenin. He remembered  all the words of friendship heartily, bashfully, spontaneously (as he  believed) addressed to him on his departure. He remembered the clasp of  hands, glances, the moments of silence, and the sound of a voice  saying, 'Good-bye, Mitya! ' when he was already in the sledge. He  remembered his own deliberate frankness. And all this had a touching  significance for him. Not only friends and relatives, not only people  who had been indifferent to him, but even those who did not like him,  seemed to have agreed to become fonder of him, or to forgive him,  before his departure, as people do before confession or death. 'Perhaps  I shall not return from the Caucasus,' he thought. And he felt that he  loved his friends and some one besides. ...

In so far as he makes  this his problem, he is at one with other philosophers in investigating  what may perhaps be considered to be the most profound problem that the  human mind has ever conceived. The fact that distinguishes Eucken from a  large number of other thinkers is that he starts where they leave off. At a rule, philosophers begin their investigation with a consideration  of matter, and proceed by slow degrees to attempt to explain the reality  at the basis of it. Some never get further, and dispense with the  question of human life and thought as mere aspects or manifestations of  the material world. ...

Yet it is those critics who have faced all the difficulties boldly, and  who have urged upon the translator both due regard for the original and  due regard for English literary standards who have made the most  valuable contributions to theory.

" We can, it  is true, point to few realizations of the ideal theory, but in  approaching a literature which possesses the English Bible, that  marvelous union of faithfulness to source with faithfulness to the  genius of the English language, we can scarcely view the problem of  translation thus hopelessly.

The farmers of Laidlaw were wont to boast, and with  reason, too, of their wheat-crops, and their fine roads and fences,  declaring that there was not in all Canada a district that would surpass  or even equal theirs in respect of these things. But beauty of this  sort a child cannot be supposed to appreciate. Christie's home for the  first ten years of her life had been in a lovely Scottish village,  within three miles of the sea on one side and less than three miles from  the hills on the other; and the dull, unvaried level, the featureless  aspect of her present home, might well seem dreary to the child. But the contrast between the old life and the new was greater still; and  here lay the secret of the shadow that seldom left the face of the  little girl now. ...

Momma said she thought  I ought to have the experience, because, though I'd been a good deal in  society in Chicago, she didn't consider that that in itself was enough. Poppa said that the journey was really nothing nowadays, and he could  easily get me a letter of introduction to the captain. Besides, in a  shipful of two or three hundred there would be sure to be some pleasant  people I could get acquainted with on the voyage. Mrs. Von Stuvdidyl,  who lives next door to us, and has been to Europe several times,  suggested that I should take a maid, and momma rather liked the idea,  but I persuaded her out of it.

She sat erect and imperious, looking  with scorn at the wreck. Two great tears welled. They overflowed. The  floods pressed behind them. She dropped her face in her hands. Before he  could reach her she had darted from the chair. The mask of scorn was  gone. She fled from him, from herself, blindly, stopping only when the  wall of the studio intervened.

It is fairly certain that an anonymous poet of 1708  represented some inner truth and vision, now alas! irrecoverable, by the  words in his "Windsor Castle":      Beneath this Palace flows fair Thames's Streams,    Where spreading Elms shade from the Sun's hot Beams;    Where beauteous Sea-Nymphs on the Waters sport,    And bulky Tritons grace the splendid Court. For him Queen Anne was like the sun, and he believed that:      Clouds with mourning Sables deck'd the Skies,    Till Anna like another Sun did rise.

No, this isn't the book you had in mind, although it does intrigue you. You consider checking it out, but you don't have much time before the next branch closes. You go outside and point your feet toward the next branch on your list.

"She'd  have found herself pretty uncomfortable this morning with nothing to  eat. And she's in for a bad cold, unless I'm mistaken, and it might very  well have been pneumonia if they'd had to stay out all night. "    "She's a softy! " declared Dolly, scornfully. "I'll bet Bessie and I  could have spent the night there and been all right, too, after it was  all over. "    "You and Bessie are both unusually strong and healthy, Dolly. It may not  be her fault that she's a softy, as you call her. The Camp Fire pays a  whole lot of attention to health. That's why Health is one of the words  that we use to make up Wo-he-lo.

> ... When, ten thousand years ago, the owl sat in the light of the moon and  unknown deities spat wisdom into the philosophies of Hermes and  Zoroaster and their more or less erudite predecessors, the earliest  gods, with their bird-like heads and male bodies, were yet vehicles of  truth, elevating the frail stock of humanity over which they threw their  benign influences. Since recorded history began, the world has had many gods, and many  books concerning them have been written, determining by much labor of  the head which should be worshiped, rather than impressing the heart  with sincere desire to travel in divinely appointed ways. As "the mere  grasses," priests and kings have trampled upon the masses--have been at  once their masters, their deities and interpreters of deity. ...

> ... "  A friend once reported to me a saying of Matthew Arnold's, that he did  not believe in any man of intelligence taking a desperate view of the  social problem in England. I am afraid that saying relegates me to the  ranks of the fools, but I am content to remain there. I believe that  never since 1381, which is the date of the Peasants' Revolt, has England  presented such a spectacle of the happiness of the tens, of the misery of  the millions. It is not by any means the artisan, or the general or the  agricultural labourer, who is the only sufferer. All society groans  under the slavery of stupendous toil and a pittance wage. The negro  slavery of the Southern States of America was better than the white  slavery of to-day all over the earth, but more particularly in Europe and  in America. ...

I  stepped back, the stick swung idly, and the crowd laughed. And there the matter would have ended, for the Bishop's party were now  close upon us, had not my foot slipped on the wet grass and I fallen  backward. Seeing me thus at his mercy, the temptation proved too much  for the knight. He forgot his love of seemliness and even that his  visitors were at his elbow--and, stooping a moment to plant home a  couple of shrewd cuts, cried, "Take that! Take that, my lad! " in a  voice that rang as crisply as his thwacks. I was up in an instant; not that the pain was anything, and before our  own people I should have thought as little of shame, for if the old  may not lay hand to the young, being related, where is to be any  obedience? ...

This doesn't sound familiar at all. Frowning, you leave the book on a reshelving cart and stride out into the evening air, ready to try another library branch.

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*Eve's Diary, Complete*.'

The minute I set  eyes on an animal I know what it is. I don't have to reflect a moment;  the right name comes out instantly, just as if it were an inspiration,  as no doubt it is, for I am sure it wasn't in me half a minute before. I seem to know just by the shape of the creature and the way it acts  what animal it is. When the dodo came along he thought it was a wildcat--I saw it in his  eye. But I saved him. And I was careful not to do it in a way that  could hurt his pride. I just spoke up in a quite natural way of  pleasing surprise, and not as if I was dreaming of conveying  information, and said, "Well, I do declare, if there isn't the dodo! ...
