# If on an winter's night a library cardholder

Long ago, you read a book. It was a wonderful book: transporting, enlightening, beautiful. Just this afternoon, you remembered this book in a moment of drowsiness. That book! What was it called? You have forgotten the title. What a pity. 

But surely one of the public libraries of New York City will have this book in their collections. It's only 4:00; you have time. You pocket your MetroCard and leave your apartment, heading to the first library branch on your list.

> ... As he and the grasshopper were walking along again, they saw a  beautiful, big butterfly sitting on a tall, yellow poppy. It was quite  still. So Billy said, "That butterfly is asleep! I'm going to put it in  my hat and take it home! "    "He is not asleep! " contradicted the grasshopper. "He has just waked up! He is waiting for his wings to grow strong, so he can fly. Leave him  here in the sunshine. He would be very unhappy if you took him into your  house! " The grasshopper hopped way out of sight, for this was the very  longest speech he had ever made. "O, please come back, grasshopper! " called Billy, "and tell me, did the  butterfly sleep on that flower? "    The grasshopper was beside Billy before he had finished speaking. "No,  no! " he replied to Billy's question. "He slept in the little house that  he made for himself before he went to sleep! " The grasshopper looked at  an empty cocoon hanging from a twig of a tree. "Is that his house? ...

 You approach a librarian who is wearing smart tortoiseshell glasses. 'Can I help you?' she asks.

'I hope,' you reply. 'I'm looking for a book, but can't remember the title. I think it had a red cover...'

She waits for more information, and when you offer none, she makes a small sound in her throat.

'Well, this one is a classic, and several other patrons have sought it out recently,' she says politely, leading you to a shelf with a familiar-looking red book on it. 'Lovely title, isn't it?' she adds. '*The Mermaid of Druid Lake, and Other Stories*.'

The two men  who were in it craned their necks most industriously at the sight of a  pair of lovers out so early and seated in such an unusual spot for  sentimental couples. When he turned to make the explanations she had asked, he found it a  harder task than he had imagined. Her knowledge of human inventions, of  worldly means of locomotion, was not extensive, and he had to begin with  the A B C of it and go through a course in elementary mechanics. After  the forty-second paragraph of instructions the damsel clapped her hands  gleefully and cried:    "It would be great fun to take a trip in one! "    "It is great fun," declared Edwin, for a moment forgetting to whom he  was talking. "But then I couldn't do it! " she exclaimed in disappointment. "I  couldn't leave the lake. ...

And  to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up. From this time forward Jesus began His teaching of repentance because  the kingdom of God is at hand. As Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon, called Peter, and  Andrew, his brother. They were fishers and were casting a net into the  sea. He said to them, Follow me and I will make you fishers of men. They left their nets and followed Him. Going on from there, Jesus saw two other brethren, James, the son of  Zebedee, and John. They were in a boat, mending their nets, with  Zebedee, their father. ...
